'), ('./static/7.mp4', 614, u'So when I read a paper [NOISE] um, uh, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 618, u"I don't, I don't bother the authors "), ('./static/7.mp4', 620, u"unless I've actually like tried to figure it out myself.

"), ('./static/7.mp4', 780, u'Yeah. I think this is an interesting one. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 783, u'Um, Robert turn on over and over and then data augmentation. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 789, u'[NOISE] Um, data augmentation is one of those techniques that um, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 793, u'uh, is a way to reduce '), ('./static/7.mp4', 795, u"the variance in your learning algorithm because you're generating more data. "), ('./static/7.mp4', 798, u'And ah, having worked on this problem I happen to know data augmentation works uh, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 804, u'is very useful for this problem. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 806, u"But if you didn't already know that fact this is "), ('./static/7.mp4', 809, u'one of the things I would probably not do right away, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 811, u'because I would train a quick and dirty system validate that you really '), ('./static/7.mp4', 815, u'have a high variance problem before investing the effort into data augmentation. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 820, u'So data augment is one of those techniques that so you know, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 822, u'like it never hurts here or it rarely hurts, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 824, u"usually helps but I don't bother to make that investment unless you have "), ('./static/7.mp4', 829, u'collected the evidence that you actually have '), ('./static/7.mp4', 831, u'a high variance problem and that this is actually a good use of your time. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 835, u'Right. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 846, u'Yeah. [NOISE] I think this, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 848, u'this one actually, this is actually nice. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 853, u'So um, uh, record everyone at startup saying, Robert turn on 100 times. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 857, u'So rea- really nice thing about that. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 859, u'You get it done really quickly. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 861, u"Um, uh, when I'm working with teams um, "), ('./static/7.mp4', 865, u'I actually think in terms of hours, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 867, u'in terms of how long it take us to do something. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 869, u'So this one you can probably do in like 30 minutes. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 873, u'Right so you get your data set collected in 30 minutes and get going. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 876, u'Uh, or, or, or you run around Stanford and just ask you know '), ('./static/7.mp4', 879, u'friends or strangers to speak into your uh, uh, laptop microphone. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 884, u'You could spend a few hours to get a much bigger data set than possibly at startup. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 887, u'I probably do that. Probably I should go and collect '), ('./static/7.mp4', 889, u'data in several hours rather than only spend 30 minutes. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 893, u'But this is actually pretty interesting as well because it lets you '), ('./static/7.mp4', 895, u'get it done really quickly. That makes sense? '), ('./static/7.mp4', 897, u'Right. [NOISE] So um, yeah. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 904, u'So let me actually uh, uh, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 906, u'share some more concrete advice. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 908, u'Right. And, and I think I should someti- sometime back um, to, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 911, u"to prepare a homework problem that you'll see later in this course. "), ('./static/7.mp4', 914, u"Ken and Eunice and I, we're actually you know building the system partially to, "), ('./static/7.mp4', 919, u'to, to create a homework right, that, that, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 920, u"that you'll see later in this course. So this is like a [NOISE]. "), ('./static/7.mp4', 923, u'Uh, this trigger word thing is '), ('./static/7.mp4', 925, u"a nice learning example that we're using in a few points throughout this course. "), ('./static/7.mp4', 929, u"Um, so here's one thing you can do. "), ('./static/7.mp4', 932, u"Uh, and this, this is actually what's um, "), ('./static/7.mp4', 934, u'[NOISE] what we did. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 935, u'Right. Which is uh, collect [NOISE] um, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 939, u'well simplifying a little bit um, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 942, u'[NOISE] collect a hundred examples [NOISE] of uh, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 949, u'uh, 10-second audio clips. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 954, u'Right? And so, uh, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 957, u'it turns out once you grab a hold of someone, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 960, u'uh, and ask them to speak into your microphone, you know, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 963, u'you can keep them for, um, three seconds '), ('./static/7.mp4', 966, u'which is how long it takes to say, Robert turn on '), ('./static/7.mp4', 968, u"or you can keep them for ten seconds which they're actually very "), ('./static/7.mp4', 971, u'willing to spend the extra seven seconds with you. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 973, u'Right? Um, but so if this is ten seconds of audio data, you know, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 978, u'so this is ten seconds of audio, right, and, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 980, u'and audio is just patterns of, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 981, u'uh, little changes in air pressure. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 984, u'Right. So, if you plot audio, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 985, u'the reason it looks like this waveform. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 986, u"It's just, uh, the, "), ('./static/7.mp4', 988, u"the way you're hearing my voice is you know, "), ('./static/7.mp4', 990, u'my voice or the speakers are creating very rapid changes in air pressure and '), ('./static/7.mp4', 994, u'your ear measures those very rapid changes in '), ('./static/7.mp4', 996, u'air pressure, interprets the sound and so a microphone, uh, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 999, u'is a sensitive device for recording these very very high frequency changes in '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1004, u'air pressure and these plots that you see '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1006, u'in audio is just, what is the air pressure at different moments in time. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1009, u'Right? But so given a, um, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1012, u'uh, ten second clip like this. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1015, u'If this is a three-second section, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1020, u'where they said, Robert turn on, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1022, u'then what you would like to do is to build a desk lamp say, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1027, u'that can sit here and the lamp is turned off, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1029, u'turned off, turn off, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1031, u'turned off, turned off, turned off. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1034, u'And at the moment they finish saying, Robert turn on, yeah, you turn it on. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1038, u'So this is, uh, output label y really, right?. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1042, u"And then, and then it's not detecting the phrase. "), ('./static/7.mp4', 1045, u'So- so what you want to do for the trigger word system is, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1048, u'um, at you know, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1050, u'pretty much the moment they finished saying Robert turn on, uh, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1054, u"you once your learning algorithm to output a one, that's your target label y saying, "), ('./static/7.mp4', 1059, u'"Yeah, I just heard this trigger word."

Cause- because, uh, and the one is when you '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1067, u'decide to turn on the lamp at that moment in time. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1070, u'Right? So to collect the data set, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1073, u"um, here's something you can do, "), ('./static/7.mp4', 1076, u'which is collect 100 audio clips, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1082, u'of 10 seconds each.

"), ('./static/7.mp4', 1095, u"Let's say you are running around Stanford and you want to collect 100 audio clips, "), ('./static/7.mp4', 1100, u'uh, uh, maybe 10 people, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1103, u'10 clips per person or maybe 100 different people. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1106, u'Um, I will actually estimate, you know, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1108, u'if you go to Stanford cafeteria uh, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1111, u'how long does it take to get one person? '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1113, u'You can probably get one person every minute or two, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1116, u'if you go to a busy place on, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1117, u'on like the Stanford cafeteria. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1119, u'So you could probably get this done in like, uh, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1121, u'100 to 200 minutes, like, two or three hours right? '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1124, u"It's not that bad. So you get this done quite quickly. "), ('./static/7.mp4', 1126, u'Um, and so and, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1129, u"and let's say you collect 100 audio clips and actually for the, "), ('./static/7.mp4', 1132, u'for the, for the purposes of, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1134, u"uh, today let's say, "), ('./static/7.mp4', 1136, u'you collect 100 audio clips to use for training, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1141, u'25 for your dev set, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1145, u'um, [NOISE] and zero for the test set. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1150, u"Right.

'), ('./static/7.mp4', 1174, u"So it's pretty easy to get started. "), ('./static/7.mp4', 1175, u'Um, and then. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1179, u'[NOISE] '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1188, u'All right. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1196, u'So taking that audio clip from above, um, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1200, u'one thing you can do to turn this into a supervised learning problem, uh, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1205, u'is to take- so the, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1207, u'the phrase Robert turn on can be said in less than three seconds.

'), ('./static/7.mp4', 1217, u"So let's say here was when Robert turn on was said. "), ('./static/7.mp4', 1221, u'So what you can do is, uh, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1222, u'oh, right,  and the target label is zero, zero, zero, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1225, u'zero, zero, zero, zero one, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1226, u'zero, zero, zero, zero. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1228, u'Um, what you can do is then clip out different audio clips of three seconds. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1233, u"So here's one audio clip, "), ('./static/7.mp4', 1235, u'you can take that audio clip. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1238, u'This is X and the target label is zero because, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1242, u'because was Robert turn on was not said [NOISE]. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1244, u'Um, and you can take on- on this audio clip at different random, each clipped, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1251, u'three second clip and that clip also has a target label 0. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1257, u'Um, and you know, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1260, u'for this one right? '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1262, u'Which is a three-second clip that can, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1265, u'that-that, that ends at, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1266, u'uh, on, the last part of the on sound you would have a target label of 1. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1272, u'Right? So, and- and when- when you learn about sequence models, RNNs, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1276, u'you learn a better method than this explicit clipping. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1279, u"But for now let's say you take these, "), ('./static/7.mp4', 1281, u'um, audio clips and turn it into, uh, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1284, u'three- so take a 10 second clip and by clipping '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1287, u'out ran- different windows you can take your, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1290, u"um, let's say 100, uh- uh, clips. "), ('./static/7.mp4', 1295, u'And because for each ten second clip you can take different windows, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1299, u'you could turn this into let say, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1300, u'uh, 3,000 [NOISE] training examples. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1306, u'Right? So here I took a ten second clip and - and [NOISE] show, you know, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1311, u'took three different three second windows, but you take 30 three second windows, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1316, u'then each 10 second audio clip becomes 30 examples. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1320, u"And now, you've turned a problem into "), ('./static/7.mp4', 1322, u'a binary classification problem where you need to train a neural network '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1325, u'that inputs a three-second clip and labels it as either zero or one. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1331, u'Right? This make sense? '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1332, u'And so this is an example of, uh, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1334, u'the- the more complex, uh, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1337, u'pipelines you might have, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1339, u"if you're building a learning algorithm. "), ('./static/7.mp4', 1341, u'So take a continuous, you know, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1344, u'audio detection problem and turn it into '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1345, u"a binary classification problem which you've "), ('./static/7.mp4', 1347, u'learned how to build various neural networks for. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1350, u'Right? And again, when you learn about RNNs, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1352, u'you learn about other ways to process sequence data or temporal data. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1355, u'Okay. So, um, oh, go ahead. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1360, u'[inaudible] uh is that manually getting the data? '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1360, u'[NOISE] Uh is this manually getting, yes, I would, yeah, actually, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1369, u'if you have 100 examples, uh, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1372, u"it's not that hard to just listen to it on your laptop or "), ('./static/7.mp4', 1375, u'some audio playing software to figure out when- when they finished saying, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1381, u'uh, Robert turn on. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1382, u'And then at that moment to put a one in the target label right? '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1385, u'Because this is really when you want the lamp to turn on, right? '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1389, u'Makes sense? Cool. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1392, u'So, um, any other questions? '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1396, u'Actually, feel free to ask clarifying questions, yeah, go ahead. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1399, u'I, I wonder if this is gonna cause a problem but  ones are too sparse. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1404, u'Oh, sure, let me get back to that. Anything else? All right. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1409, u'Is there a specific reason why you only train them on a few seconds instead of ten seconds, [inaudible] '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1417, u'[inaudible] '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1419, u'[NOISE] I see, yeah, why do we do three seconds, or four or five seconds '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1422, u"then there's another hyperparameter to contend. So I think. "), ('./static/7.mp4', 1426, u"uh, [NOISE] I don't know, "), ('./static/7.mp4', 1428, u'you have say it really slowly to take a few seconds is this, right? '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1436, u'This is Robert turn on. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1440, u'And so again is this design choice? '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1443, u'[LAUGHTER] Um, yeah,  all right. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1447, u"So, so, um, let's say you do this, "), ('./static/7.mp4', 1451, u'feed it to a supervised learning algorithm, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1454, u'train a neural network, um, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1456, u"and let's say that when you classify this, "), ('./static/7.mp4', 1459, u'ah, when, when you run this algorithm, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1461, u'you end up with 99.5 percent accuracy [NOISE] right? Um, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1468, u'uh, but you find that the algorithm has zero detections. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1475, u'[NOISE] '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1483, u'Right? Um, and, and what I mean is that whatever audio you give it, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1489, u'it just output zero all the time. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1492, u'So the algorithm just says, nope, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1493, u'I never heard the phrase "Robert turn on", you know. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1496, u'So, so, uh, so, uh, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1500, u'so, so my question to you is, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1503, u'you know- and by the way, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1504, u"the reason I'm going through these scenarios is, "), ('./static/7.mp4', 1506, u'um, I found that, uh, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1509, u'a good way to gain good intuitions and, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1512, u'and to become good at making these decisions, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1514, u'is these are the decisions that a project leader, ri ght, or a tech leader or a CEO needs to make. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1519, u'These are actually like pretty much exactly the decisions you need to make. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1522, u'And I find that, um, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1523, u'one of the ways to gain this type of experience is you, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1526, u'you know, find a job with a good AI team and work with them for five years, right? '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1531, u'And then you actually live through this and you see what they do. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1533, u'But instead of needing you to go and spend five years to see ten examples of this, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1538, u"I'm trying to step you through maybe one example in, in one hour. "), ('./static/7.mp4', 1543, u'So, so instead of, uh, you know, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1545, u'gaining this experience through work experience, which is great, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1549, u'but takes many, many years [LAUGHTER] or many, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1551, u'many months hoping to, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1553, u"you know, let's just put you in the position of making these decisions. "), ('./static/7.mp4', 1556, u'You can learn from them much faster, right? '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1559, u"Um, so- and all the examples I'm giving are actually completely realistic, right? "), ('./static/7.mp4', 1565, u"They're either exactly or very similar to things I have seen in, "), ('./static/7.mp4', 1570, u'in actual, you know, very real projects. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1572, u'So question is your learning algorithm gives this result, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1576, u'95 percent accuracy, zero detections, what do you do? '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1579, u'Let me mention some of- some of the answers I really liked. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1583, u'I think that, uh, um, you know, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1588, u'I- when I think of building learning algorithms, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1591, u'the process is often specify a dev set and/or test set that measure what you care about.

"), ('./static/7.mp4', 1602, u"It's just- it is, "), ('./static/7.mp4', 1604, u'uh, sharpens the clarity of your thinking, right? '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1607, u'If you have a very clear specification of the problem. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1609, u'And I think one insight out of this is that if your dev set is really out of whack, right? '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1614, u"Because it's so unbalanced, "), ('./static/7.mp4', 1615, u"that accuracy in your dev set doesn't translate to what you actually care about. "), ('./static/7.mp4', 1620, u'Because, you know, presumably, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1621, u'this is 99.5 percent accurate on the dev set as well. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1624, u'But this performance is terrible.

'), ('./static/7.mp4', 1630, u'So I think of it as good hygiene. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1632, u'You know, this is kind of good sound practice, uh, to, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1636, u'to just specify, make sure you at least have a dev set and '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1639, u'evaluation metric that corresponds more closely to what you care about. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1643, u'So making the dev set more balanced, uh, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1645, u'equal numbers of positive and negative would, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1647, u'would be a good step toward that. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1649, u'Um, and then I think, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1652, u'um, uh, you could also, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1655, u'um- there are a few people that talked about, um, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1658, u'give the higher weights to the positive examples, right? '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1661, u'So, you know, um, uh, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1663, u'one way to do this is to resample your training and your dev sets to make '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1668, u'them more proportionate in terms of '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1670, u'maybe closer to a balanced ratio positive negative examples. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1673, u"That'd be okay. The other way to not do resampling, "), ('./static/7.mp4', 1675, u"we'd just give the positive examples a greater weight, right? "), ('./static/7.mp4', 1678, u'Um, I would probably resample. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1681, u'Um, another thing you could do, um, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1683, u'uh, you know, in the, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1685, u'in the interests of, um, speed, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1689, u"even if it's not the mathematically most, "), ('./static/7.mp4', 1691, u'most sound thing to do, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1692, u'is to change the target labels to be a bunch of ones after that. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1698, u'And this is a hack, this is not formally rigorous. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1701, u"But if you've implemented the rest of this code already, "), ('./static/7.mp4', 1705, u'this might be a reasonable, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1706, u'you know, a little bit hacky thing to do. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1708, u'But this is- this, this, this might work well enough. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1710, u"Right? I would- I might not- I don't know if I would want "), ('./static/7.mp4', 1714, u'to try to write an academic research paper with this method, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1718, u'maybe you can get away with it. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1719, u'But this little thing that I think if you tried to publish a paper with this, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1722, u'academic reviewers might raise their eyebrows and say maybe, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1726, u'you know, maybe this is okay. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1727, u'But I think if you want something quick and dirty, that just works. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1730, u'I think, uh, uh, labeling the ones, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1733, u"changing a bunch of labels to be ones so that's, "), ('./static/7.mp4', 1736, u'say, a clip here, right? '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1740, u"Uh, that ends just a little bit after Robert turn on, that's still labeled one, "), ('./static/7.mp4', 1744, u"that'll be pretty reasonable. "), ('./static/7.mp4', 1745, u'But this will be saying that, uh, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1748, u'for anywhere [NOISE] within maybe a 0.5 second period after Robert turn on finished, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1754, u"it's okay to turn on the light anytime within that period. "), ('./static/7.mp4', 1757, u'That you kind of wanna be turning on the light. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1759, u'Turning on the lamp, you know, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1761, u'say within half a second, right, after Robert turn on is- has been said. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1767, u'And this would be a not- this would be a way to just get more labels of ones in there. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1773, u'All right, that makes sense? Yeah? '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1777, u'With like rebalancing your data sets with [inaudible] , '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1782, u'how does that translate to when you deploy this, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1784, u"you're not going to see Robert turn on as much, right? "), ('./static/7.mp4', 1788, u'Like one out of 1,000 might be reflected, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1790, u'but what do we expect to see? '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1792, u'Yeah, yeah. Right. So, um, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1795, u'I think that, uh- how do we put it? '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1797, u'Um, so if you actually- yes, so uh, this, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1801, u'this is sort of a dev set and evaluation measure kind of question, right? '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1805, u'So, uh, one of the- a couple of the metrics that people often use, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1809, u'uh, when actually working on this, is, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1811, u'uh, when someone says Robert turn on, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1813, u'what is the chance that it actually wakes up, or the lamp turns on? '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1817, u'And then the second is, if no one is saying anything to the lamp, you know, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1821, u'how often does it randomly turn on by itself without you having said anything? '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1825, u'So those are the two metrics people actually use. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1828, u'And, and sometimes you also '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1830, u'try to combine them in a single number evaluation metric or something. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1833, u'Uh, but I think that, um, uh, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1836, u'you could identify the data sets and measure both of these things. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1839, u'And then, and then hopefully find a way to combine them '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1841, u'into a single real number, which I think- yeah. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1843, u'And I think one of the ways you talked about in the, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1845, u'in the videos as well as, right? '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1847, u'Does that make sense? Uh, yeah. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1848, u'But I think- I think, uh, so the question is really, um, uh, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1851, u'on what is it that satisfies a user need, right? '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1855, u'And, uh, and just one, one thing about, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1857, u'uh, the straightforward way of rebalancing, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1860, u"is that if you don't do this then your whole data set, "), ('./static/7.mp4', 1863, u'just has very few positive examples, right? '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1867, u'Um, and so if you throw away all the negative examples, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1871, u'so that you cut down the number of negative examples until '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1873, u'you have exactly equal numbers of positives and negatives, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1876, u"you've actually thrown away a lot of negative examples. "), ('./static/7.mp4', 1879, u'This makes sense? And so one, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1881, u'one problem with the straightforward way of rebalancing, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1883, u'is that, you know, in your audio clip, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1886, u'in your test 10 second clip that we collected by running around Stanford, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1890, u'um, you have one example of Robert turn on. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1894, u'And so if you want exactly per, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1897, u'perfectly balanced positive and negative, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1900, u"it means that you're allowed to only clip out one negative example out of this. "), ('./static/7.mp4', 1905, u"You can say, that's negative and that's a positive. "), ('./static/7.mp4', 1907, u"And you can't clip out more negative examples from this, right? "), ('./static/7.mp4', 1912, u'So, so if you use, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1913, u'uh- if you insist on a perfect rebalance, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1915, u"you're actually throwing away a lot of negative examples that, "), ('./static/7.mp4', 1918, u'that could be helpful for the learning algorithm. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1921, u'Great. [NOISE] Um, so all right. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1930, u'[NOISE] So, um, you know, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1936, u'a lot of the workflow of, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1938, u'uh, building learning algorithms is, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1940, u'um, uh, building learning algorithms feels more like debugging, right? '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1944, u'Because what happens in '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1946, u"a typical machine learning workflow is you implement something and it doesn't work. "), ('./static/7.mp4', 1950, u'So you figure out what is the problem, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1951, u'so fix that, uh, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1953, u'like rebalancing or reweighting or adding more ones. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1956, u'And so that fixes the current problem. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1958, u'And then after fixing the current problem, which, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1961, u'which is the one we just solved, say, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1963, u'you then come across a new problem and you have to solve that. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1966, u'And you fix that problem, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1967, u'you click somewhere else, another new problem. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1968, u'So I find that, uh, the workflow of, um, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1971, u"when I'm working on a machine learning project, "), ('./static/7.mp4', 1973, u'it often feels more like software debugging than software development, right? '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1978, u"Because you're often trying to figure out what doesn't work and you're trying to fix that. "), ('./static/7.mp4', 1981, u'And after you fix that problem, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1983, u'then another bug surfaces and you squash that, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1985, u'and you do that, and another, and you kind of keep doing that until the algorithm works. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1988, u'So if I keep talking about, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1990, u"you know, your algorithm doesn't work, "), ('./static/7.mp4', 1992, u'what do you do next, right? '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1993, u"That, that's kind of the theme of today's presentation. "), ('./static/7.mp4', 1996, u'But that, that is what the workflow- That is what '), ('./static/7.mp4', 1999, u'your day-to-day work of developing '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2001, u"a learning algorithm is usually like because it's like, "), ('./static/7.mp4', 2003, u"it doesn't work, and you fix it. "), ('./static/7.mp4', 2004, u"It still doesn't work, then you fix that, "), ('./static/7.mp4', 2006, u"and it still doesn't work, you fix it. "), ('./static/7.mp4', 2007, u'And you do that enough times until it works, right? '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2009, u'That, that is actually what often working '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2011, u'on a learning algorithm works- look, looks like. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2017, u"All right. So let's say you fix that problem, um, "), ('./static/7.mp4', 2022, u'and you conclude, uh, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2025, u'through doing error analysis, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2026, u'that your algorithm is overfitting, right? '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2031, u"So you know, you've- you've added a lot more ones, "), ('./static/7.mp4', 2034, u'so the dataset is a little bit more balanced. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2036, u"So let's just add a bunch of ones like I did on that previous board, "), ('./static/7.mp4', 2039, u"so let's just add a lot of ones here, "), ('./static/7.mp4', 2042, u"so the dataset isn't as unbalanced. "), ('./static/7.mp4', 2044, u"And um, [NOISE] let's see if- [NOISE], "), ('./static/7.mp4', 2057, u'um, right, okay, good. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2066, u"Let's say that- sorry [NOISE] , "), ('./static/7.mp4', 2072, u'see, too many pages of notes here. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2080, u"Okay, good. So let's say that you find that it achieves now 98 percent "), ('./static/7.mp4', 2086, u'accuracy on training and 50 percent accuracy on the dev set, right? '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2093, u'So very large gap between your training and your dev set performance, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2099, u'and so a clear sign of overfitting. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2101, u'And so I think of one of the earlier questions, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2103, u'someone talked about data augmentation, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2105, u'and so we have this clear sign of overfitting, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2108, u'this is a good time to consider data augmentation, right? '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2113, u"And then- and so let's say you go ahead and do data augmentation. "), ('./static/7.mp4', 2116, u'So for audio, this is how you could do data augmentation, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2119, u'which is, um, collect a bunch of background audio. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2123, u"You know, so I guess if you're trying to build a lab that might go into people's homes, "), ('./static/7.mp4', 2128, u"then you could go into your friends' homes and, "), ('./static/7.mp4', 2131, u'you know, with their permission, record, right? '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2134, u'What the background sound of their home looks like. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2136, u'You know, maybe there are people talking in the background, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2138, u'maybe the TV on in the background. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2139, u"Well, whatever goes on in people- people's homes. "), ('./static/7.mp4', 2142, u'Um, and then, it turns out that if you take a, um, say, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2147, u'a one second clip, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2149, u'of Robert turn on, or RTO, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2152, u'and you add that to a background clip, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2157, u'then you can synthesize an audio clip of '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2159, u"what it sounds like in your friend's house if someone were "), ('./static/7.mp4', 2162, u'to suddenly pop up and say Robert turn on '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2164, u"against the background sound of your friend's house, right? "), ('./static/7.mp4', 2168, u'And- and it turns out that, um, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2171, u'if you want to make the system robust, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2176, u'so actually, for example, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2177, u'have a- I know- I- I- I actually know someone that lives, unfortunately, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2181, u'close near to a train station and so '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2183, u'their house actually has a lot of train station noise from the Caltrain. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2186, u'And so what you can do to make your system more robust is '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2190, u'also take a clip of say train noise, right? '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2194, u'Like Caltrain noise, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2196, u'and if you take that noise and take, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2198, u"uh, in this case, let's say one-second, "), ('./static/7.mp4', 2200, u'one-second of a three-second clip of someone saying Robert turn '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2203, u'on and you synthesized that on top of the train in the background, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2208, u'then what you end up with is a 10 second clip of someone saying Robert '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2212, u'turn on against the noisy train in the background type of noise. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2217, u'All right. And so in order to do data augmentation or data synthesis, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2223, u'you can take some one-second clips of people saying Robert turn on in '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2227, u'a quiet background and then take '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2229, u'some one second clip of people saying random words, right? '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2232, u"Let's say, you know, cardinal, right? "), ('./static/7.mp4', 2235, u"Since you're Stanford, and synthesize this against "), ('./static/7.mp4', 2238, u'the train noise background and then you would have, in this case, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2241, u'you would have what sounds like train noise, train noise, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2244, u'train noise, Robert turn on, train noise, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2246, u'train noise, train noise, train noise, cardinal, train noise, and so on right? '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2249, u'And then you could generate the labels now as zeros there, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2254, u'ones there and then zeros there, right? '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2258, u"Because if this is what it actually sounded like in a user's home, "), ('./static/7.mp4', 2261, u'then you want the lamp to turn on after Robert turn on but not after these random words. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2267, u'So you can pick different random words. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2269, u"Great. Um, so let's see. "), ('./static/7.mp4', 2277, u'Great. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2283, u"So um, what I'd "), ('./static/7.mp4', 2291, u'like you to do is evaluate three different possible ways, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2299, u'um, to collect noisy data, right? '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2303, u'To- to- to collect this type of background data, right? '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2308, u"Um, and so what I'd like you to do for the next question is let's say you and your team, "), ('./static/7.mp4', 2315, u'you know, have, ah, brainstormed. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2318, u'Um, brainstormed a few different ways to collect  this type '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2324, u"of background noise data and let's say you've decided "), ('./static/7.mp4', 2329, u'that you would like to collect 10 hours of background noise data, right? '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2335, u"Okay? So I'm going to present to you three options.

"), ('./static/7.mp4', 2358, u'Second is download clips online. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2367, u'It turns out if you go to YouTube there are these like 10 hour long clips of, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2374, u'you know, rain noise or cars driving around. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2378, u'So you actually- and again, if you do that, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2382, u"find something that's Creative Commons and sort of appropriately licensed, right? "), ('./static/7.mp4', 2386, u'Another thing you could do is, ah, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2388, u'use Mechanical Turk. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2396, u'Amazon Mechanical Turk.

'), ('./static/7.mp4', 2499, u'Yeah, whether people are, actually this is a surprisingly large variability. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2503, u"I'll mention one thing that um, surprised me. "), ('./static/7.mp4', 2507, u"Um, I'll give you my own assessment. "), ('./static/7.mp4', 2510, u'I think that uh, you '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2513, u"know when I'm leading startup teams we tend to be very scrappy, right? "), ('./static/7.mp4', 2517, u'And so I think that um, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2518, u'if the goal is to collect 10 hours of data, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2521, u'if you have three friends who have a laptop you can collect '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2523, u'three hours of data per hour because you got three recordings going in parallel. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2527, u'So if I were doing this with say two other friends you know, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2531, u'I bet, I bet we could get this done by tonight, right? '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2534, u"Because if you need nine hours of data that's each person needs to collect "), ('./static/7.mp4', 2538, u'three hours of data and you run around Stanford and you keep the microphones running, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2542, u'I bet, I bet I could get this done by 6:00 PM right maybe, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2546, u"maybe even earlier I don't know. "), ('./static/7.mp4', 2548, u'Download clips online uh, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2551, u"is actually, I don't know, it's actually an interesting one, maybe be about the same time. "), ('./static/7.mp4', 2555, u'Um, it turns out one tricky thing about downloading clips online is that um, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2561, u'uh, I think a lot of the you, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2563, u'the- there are people that um, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2564, u'have trouble sleeping at night so they listen to highway noise or whatever. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2568, u'And so there are these you know 20 hours of '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2571, u'highway clips highway noise on YouTube that you can find. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2574, u"But I, I don't know how those clips are generated. "), ('./static/7.mp4', 2578, u'And I suspect a lot of them loop, right? '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2580, u"Meaning it's the same one hour played over and over. "), ('./static/7.mp4', 2583, u"So I actually think it's harder than, than, "), ('./static/7.mp4', 2585, u'than one like, yes they get 10 hours of '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2588, u"um [NOISE] non-repetitive data and it's one of those things you know, "), ('./static/7.mp4', 2592, u'if I take an hour of highway sound and loop '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2595, u"it you can't tell the difference because all highway sound sounds the same. "), ('./static/7.mp4', 2598, u"I just can't tell one minute of highway sound from another one "), ('./static/7.mp4', 2601, u'but if you have one hour of highway sound looped 10 times, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2605, u'the learning algorithm will actually perform much less well '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2608, u'than if you have 10 hours of fresh highway sound. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2611, u'So this I would actually have a harder time doing. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2613, u"I think I've probably I, "), ('./static/7.mp4', 2615, u'I, I would prob- if I were doing this I, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2617, u'because of these problems I would probably budget until sometime tomorrow, right? '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2622, u"May- may- maybe, maybe 9:00 PM or something. Maybe that's doable. "), ('./static/7.mp4', 2626, u"I'm not sure. Um, the one surprise "), ('./static/7.mp4', 2628, u'to me was some people thought they could do this by tonight. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2631, u"Uh, I, a- again I've used Amazon Mechanical Turk is actually "), ('./static/7.mp4', 2634, u'a huge process to set up Amazon Mechanical Turk, get people on board. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2638, u'Um, and especially to get them on microphone. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2640, u"Uh, uh, I don't know if you implement something "), ('./static/7.mp4', 2641, u'on Flash that can speak in their web browser. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2644, u"[NOISE] And then Flash isn't supported, it's, "), ('./static/7.mp4', 2646, u"it's, actually, it's actually not that easy to get a lot of "), ('./static/7.mp4', 2649, u'Turkers to do this and the global supply of [NOISE] Turkers is also unlimited. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2653, u'So I would, if I were doing this I would '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2656, u"probably [NOISE] I don't know maybe a week or something, right? "), ('./static/7.mp4', 2659, u"Hard to say, I'm not sure um. "), ('./static/7.mp4', 2661, u"But so the specific opinion isn't that important but I want "), ('./static/7.mp4', 2665, u'you to go through this exercise because this is how um, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2669, u'efficient startup teams should you know, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2672, u'brainstorm a list of things and then you all figure out how long you '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2675, u"think it'll take to do these things and I think uh, "), ('./static/7.mp4', 2678, u'you can have a debate about how high quality the data is, I '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2681, u'think you can get very high quality data from this and from this. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2685, u"Uh, [NOISE] I, I, I just don't trust a lot of those online audio sources. "), ('./static/7.mp4', 2689, u'Uh, but this is really fast and you can get pretty high-quality data. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2693, u'I would probably do this to collect the background sound to get going, right? '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2697, u'But I think that part of their workflow I see of you know, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2700, u'fast-moving teams is pretty much exactly what you did. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2704, u'Which one, what is that the exercise of '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2706, u'brainstorming the lists of options and then really '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2709, u'estimating or what time can we get this done and then use that to pick an option, right? '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2714, u'Um, and then I wanna just mention one last thing uh, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2719, u'which is that [NOISE] these differences matter, right? '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2727, u"Um, you know I've actually built, I've built a lot systems, built a lot of machine learning systems. "), ('./static/7.mp4', 2732, u'But um, oh and, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2734, u'and I think by the way if you do everything we just '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2736, u"described and you'll see this later in a problem set. "), ('./static/7.mp4', 2739, u'Uh, you can actually with this set of '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2741, u'ideas pretty much this set of ideas that we just went through today. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2744, u'You can actually build, build a, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2746, u'build a pretty decent trigger word detection system '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2748, u'or wake registering word detection system. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2749, u"In fact we'll oscillate through pretty much this in a later homework exercise. "), ('./static/7.mp4', 2753, u'But now you know when you get to that homework exercise when you do RNNs uh, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2757, u'you know how you could come up with this sort of process yourself if, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2761, u"if you didn't already know how to make these types of choices. Yeah, question "), ('./static/7.mp4', 2764, u'Just one question. Uh, I conduct my research [inaudible] '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2771, u'how my micro affect my result but '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2774, u"at the beginning it seems like it's not important like my micro [inaudible] "), ('./static/7.mp4', 2779, u'So when I download it, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2785, u'it, my, what mess my result but what, what you have to think about it? '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2791, u'Yeah so my advice wha- [NOISE] , '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2793, u'does the microphone affect your result, right? '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2794, u'[OVERLAPPING] My, my advice is would be to uh, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2797, u'get something going quick and dirty and then develop a data set, right, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2802, u'with the actual types of data you can develop on '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2804, u'your real microphone and then see if there is a problem and it may be er, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2808, u'different microphones do have different characteristics. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2810, u'And if it is a problem then go back and think about '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2813, u"how you collect data that's more representative how you "), ('./static/7.mp4', 2816, u'test. I wanna mention one more quick thing, you were handed '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2819, u'class surveys and wants to do something real quick which is um, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2822, u'I wanna tell you why these things really matter which is um, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2825, u'if this is uh, performance, right? '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2828, u"Uh, uh, let's say, actually let's say error. "), ('./static/7.mp4', 2830, u'And um, this is time, right? '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2834, u"And if this is today and you're the CEO of a startup remember that's, "), ('./static/7.mp4', 2838, u"that's what we're doing in this lesson. "), ('./static/7.mp4', 2840, u'And this is six months from now, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2841, u'but this is 12 months from now. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2843, u'Um, you know maybe if a competitor, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2848, u"actually maybe, maybe I don't know. "), ('./static/7.mp4', 2850, u"[LAUGHTER] Maybe because we've talked about this so much in "), ('./static/7.mp4', 2853, u'this class maybe two of you in this class are  gonna build a startup and be a competitor. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2857, u'Um, but over time most machine learning teams, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2864, u'you know the error actually goes down over time as you work on problems, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2868, u'very good and this is what I see in tons of practical projects. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2871, u'You know, we work on project, improve the system, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2873, u'and the error actually goes down over time as you work on '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2876, u"this over the next 12 months say but if you're really a CEO of "), ('./static/7.mp4', 2879, u"a startup doing this [NOISE] and it turns out that it's "), ('./static/7.mp4', 2882, u'the startups that have the discipline to constantly be the most efficient. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2885, u"Um, don't do something that takes you two days. "), ('./static/7.mp4', 2888, u'If you can get a similar result in one day. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2890, u"The difference is not that you're one day slower, "), ('./static/7.mp4', 2893, u'the difference is that you are 2x faster, right? '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2895, u'And then, then having that mindset if we take '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2898, u'this whole chart and compress it on the horizontal axis. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2901, u'Um then you [NOISE] want to '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2906, u'be this startup that you know makes '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2908, u'the same amount of process in six months instead of 12 months, right? '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2911, u"And because uh, if you're able to do this then "), ('./static/7.mp4', 2914, u'your startup will actually perform much better in the marketplace. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2918, u"Assuming your accuracy's important which it seems to be for wake word. "), ('./static/7.mp4', 2921, u"And so don't think of this as saving you a day here "), ('./static/7.mp4', 2924, u'and there think of this as making your team twice as fast. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2927, u"And that's the difference between this level "), ('./static/7.mp4', 2929, u'of performance and that level of performance. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2931, u"So that's why when I'm, you know building teams to "), ('./static/7.mp4', 2933, u'and executing these projects I tend to be pretty obsessive about uh, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2937, u"making sure we're very efficient in exploring the options "), ('./static/7.mp4', 2940, u"and [NOISE] don't wait till tomorrow to collect data of "), ('./static/7.mp4', 2943, u'dubious quality when you have a better idea of collecting '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2946, u'data by today because the difference is not that you wasted 12 hours, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2949, u'the difference you are twice as slow as a company, right? '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2952, u'So I think uh, so hopefully through this example on '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2955, u'your ongoing experiences throughout this course it can help '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2958, u'you continue to get better at this. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2961, u'Right. Um, last thing we want to do [NOISE] was uh, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2964, u"we're about halfway through the course and go ahead um, "), ('./static/7.mp4', 2966, u'we went to hand out a survey um, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2968, u'an anonymous survey uh, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2970, u'to get some feedback from you about this class. '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2973, u'And whenever we get these surveys uh, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2976, u'we end up uh, uh, '), ('./static/7.mp4', 2977, u"thanks to previous generations of students' feedback.
