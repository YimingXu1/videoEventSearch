[('./static/3.mp4', 0, u'[NOISE] Okay. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 7, u'Hey, everyone. Um, morning. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 9, u'Welcome to CS230, Deep Learning. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 12, u'Um, so many of you know that, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 16, u'um, Deep Learning these days is the latest hardest area of computer science or AI. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 21, u'Uh, arguably, Deep Learning is the latest hardest area of, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 25, u'you know, all of human activity, uh, uh, maybe. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 28, u'Um, but this is called CS230 Deep Learning where we hope that we can help you understand '), ('./static/3.mp4', 34, u'the state of the art and become experts at building and applying Deep Learning systems. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 40, u'Um, unlike many Stanford classes, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 42, u'this class will be more interactive than, than others, uh, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 46, u'because in this class we offer in the flipped classroom format where '), ('./static/3.mp4', 50, u"we'll ask you to watch a lot of the videos at home, uh, uh, "), ('./static/3.mp4', 54, u'a lot of the deeplearning.AI content hosted on Coursera, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 58, u'thus preserving the classroom in discussion section time for much deeper discussions.

"), ('./static/3.mp4', 234, u'Uh, and, um, it turns out that a lot of '), ('./static/3.mp4', 238, u'the ideas of deep learning happened around for several decades, right? '), ('./static/3.mp4', 242, u'The, the basic ideas of deep learning happened around for decades. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 245, u'So, why is deep learning suddenly taking off now? '), ('./static/3.mp4', 248, u'Why is it, quote, Coming out of nowhere? '), ('./static/3.mp4', 250, u'or what- whatever people say. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 252, u'Um, I think that the main reason that deep learning has been taking off, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 256, u'uh, and why, you know, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 258, u'suddenly all of you hopefully will be the, do really, um, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 261, u'powerful things with it much more effectively '), ('./static/3.mp4', 263, u'than two or three years ago is the following. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 266, u'Um, for a lot of, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 269, u'over the last couple of decades with the digitalization of society, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 273, u"we've just collected more and more data.

'), ('./static/3.mp4', 285, u'Uh, uh, and, and, um, and, um, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 288, u'what used to be represented through pieces of '), ('./static/3.mp4', 291, u'paper is now much more likely to be a digital record as well. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 294, u"So you're, if you go take an X-ray, uh, as at, "), ('./static/3.mp4', 297, u'at least in the United States, uh, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 298, u'less than some other kind, in developing economies, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 300, u'but basically the United States, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 301, u"there's a much higher chance now that your X-ray in "), ('./static/3.mp4', 304, u'the hospital is a digital image rather than physical piece of film. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 307, u'Or, um, if you order a new marker, right? '), ('./static/3.mp4', 311, u"There's a much higher chance that the fact that you ordered a marker, you know, "), ('./static/3.mp4', 314, u'off a website is now represented as a digital record compared to, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 319, u'uh, 10 years ago when the state of the global supply chain. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 322, u'Actually if you order, uh, if you order 10,000 markers, um, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 326, u"there's a much higher chance, you know, "), ('./static/3.mp4', 327, u'10 years ago that the fact that you place that order was stored on a piece of paper.

'), ('./static/3.mp4', 335, u"But now there's much more likely to be a digital record. "), ('./static/3.mp4', 338, u'And so the fact that, um, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 339, u'so many pieces of paper are now digital has created data. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 343, u'And, uh, for a lot of application areas, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 346, u'the amount of data has sort of, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 353, u'you know, exploded over the last 20 years. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 357, u'But what we found was that, um, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 360, u'if you look at more traditional learning algorithms, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 368, u'traditional machine learning algorithms, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 371, u'the performance of most of them would plateau, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 374, u'uh, even as you feed it more and more data. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 376, u'So, by traditional learning algorithms, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 378, u'I mean logistic regressions, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 380, u'support vector machines, you know, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 381, u'maybe decision trees depending on influential details, uh, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 384, u"and it was as if our older learning algorithms didn't know "), ('./static/3.mp4', 387, u'what to do if all the data you can now feed it. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 389, u'Um, but what we start to define several years ago, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 392, u'was if you train a small neural network, right? '), ('./static/3.mp4', 398, u'Its performance may look like that. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 400, u'If you train a medium, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 402, u'neural net, its performance may look like that. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 404, u'And if you train a very large neural net, you know, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 408, u'the performance kinda keeps on getting better and better, uh, up to some, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 411, u'usually up to some theoretical limit called base error rate, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 414, u"which you'll learn about later this quarter, "), ('./static/3.mp4', 415, u'but where performance can never exceed a 100 percent, but, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 418, u'but sometimes, uh, uh, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 420, u"sometimes there's some seeding of the performance. "), ('./static/3.mp4', 422, u"But onset, we've been able to measure on many, many problems, uh, "), ('./static/3.mp4', 426, u'with not yet, I think that across machine learning and deep learning broadly, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 430, u"I think we've not yet hit the limits of scale and by scale I mean, um, "), ('./static/3.mp4', 434, u'the amount of data you can throw at the problem '), ('./static/3.mp4', 436, u'that is still useful for the problem as well as, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 439, u'um, the size of the neural networks. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 441, u'And I think, um, you know, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 443, u'GPU computing, uh, uh, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 446, u'was a large part of how we were able to go '), ('./static/3.mp4', 449, u'from training small to medium to now training very large neural networks. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 453, u'And once upon a time, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 455, u'I think, um, you know, the first, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 456, u'actually I think a lot of the early work on, uh, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 459, u'training neural networks on GPUs, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 461, u'which is done here at Stanford, right? '), ('./static/3.mp4', 463, u'Crew there using cruder to the train neural networks. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 466, u'But, um, what use to be, you know, one thing, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 469, u"one lessons we've learned over and over in computing is that, uh, "), ('./static/3.mp4', 472, u"what yesterday's supercomputer is today's, uh, "), ('./static/3.mp4', 475, u'uh, you know, processor on your, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 477, u'on your smartwatch, right? '), ('./static/3.mp4', 478, u'And so what used to be an amount of computation that was accessible only to, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 483, u'you know, large research labs in Stanford. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 485, u'They could spend a $100,000 on GPUs. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 487, u'Today, you could rent that on a- on a cloud relatively inexpensively. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 491, u'And so the availability of '), ('./static/3.mp4', 493, u'relatively large neural network training capabilities has '), ('./static/3.mp4', 496, u'allowed really students, really almost everyone. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 499, u'Many people, not, not many, many people, um, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 503, u'to have enough access to computational power to train what, uh, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 507, u'large enough neural networks to drive '), ('./static/3.mp4', 509, u'very high acc- levels of accuracy for a lot of applications, right? '), ('./static/3.mp4', 513, u'Um, and it turns out that, uh, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 517, u'uh, if you look broadly across AI, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 521, u'you know, I, I think the mass media, right? '), ('./static/3.mp4', 523, u'Newspapers, you know, reporters use the term AI. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 526, u'I think, uh, uh, within, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 528, u'within academia or within the industry, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 530, u'we tend to say machine learning and deep learning. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 532, u'Uh, uh, but i- if you look broadly across AI, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 535, u'it turns out that AI, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 537, u"um, has many, many tools that's beyond machine learning, "), ('./static/3.mp4', 540, u"that's even beyond deep learning. "), ('./static/3.mp4', 542, u'And if any of you take, you know, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 543, u"CS221, right, Stanford's AI class, "), ('./static/3.mp4', 545, u"great class, uh, uh, you'll learn about a lot of these other tools of AI. "), ('./static/3.mp4', 550, u'But the reason that deep learning is so valuable '), ('./static/3.mp4', 553, u'today is that if you look across many of the tools of AI, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 558, u"let's say [NOISE], you know, "), ('./static/3.mp4', 560, u"there's a deep learning [NOISE] /machine learning, um, and, "), ('./static/3.mp4', 565, u'and, and again, some of you know, uh, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 567, u'neural networks and deep learning mean almost exactly the same thing, right? '), ('./static/3.mp4', 571, u"It's just that, um, as, you know, "), ('./static/3.mp4', 573, u'as we start to see deep learning rise over the last several years, we found that, uh, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 577, u'deep learning was just a much more, um, attractive brand. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 582, u'And so, you know, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 583, u"and so, so that's the brand that took off. "), ('./static/3.mp4', 586, u'Uh, uh, but, um, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 588, u'if you look at, if you, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 589, u'if you take an AI class, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 590, u'you look broadly across the portfolio of tools you have in AI. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 593, u'Um, I think that, you know, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 595, u'our often use deep learning and machine learning, um, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 598, u'are sometimes also use their probabilistic graphical model, right? '), ('./static/3.mp4', 602, u'We shall learn about it in CS- CS228, also a great class.

"), ('./static/3.mp4', 609, u'You need a motion planning algorithm. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 611, u'You need various planning algorithms.

'), ('./static/3.mp4', 708, u'But the one that has taken off, you know, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 711, u'in- in- incredibly quickly is deep learning, machine learning. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 716, u'And I think a lot of this progress was, uh, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 719, u'initially driven, uh, by scale. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 723, u'Scale of data and scale of computation. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 725, u'The fact that we can now get tons of '), ('./static/3.mp4', 727, u'data throw it into a giant neural network and get good performance. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 730, u'But, uh, more recently has been also driven by, um, uh, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 734, u'the positive feedback loop of, um, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 737, u'seeing early traction in deep learning thus causing '), ('./static/3.mp4', 740, u'a lot more people to do research in deep learning algorithms. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 743, u"And so there's been tons of algorithmic innovation in "), ('./static/3.mp4', 746, u'deep learning in the last several years and you '), ('./static/3.mp4', 748, u'hear a lot about other algorithms that were, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 750, u'you know, relatively recently invented in this class as well. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 753, u'All right. Um, and so really, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 756, u'I think that the initially the twin forces of a scale data scale computation, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 760, u'but now the triple forces have also '), ('./static/3.mp4', 762, u'a lot of algorithmic innovation and massive investment, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 764, u'um, is continuing to make deep learning, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 767, u'uh, make tremendous progress. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 769, u'And so in CS230, uh, because of the, uh, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 774, u'uh, you know, I- I- I think our two main goals. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 778, u'Uh, the first is to, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 780, u'uh, um, have you, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 782, u'uh, become experts in the deep learning algorithms. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 785, u'Have you- have you learned the state of the art? '), ('./static/3.mp4', 787, u'Have you- have you- have you have deep technical knowledge on, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 790, u'um, the state of the art in deep learning. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 793, u'Um, and second is to give you the know how to '), ('./static/3.mp4', 796, u'apply these algorithms to whatever problems you want to work on. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 800, u"So, uh, one of the things I've learned- so I think, "), ('./static/3.mp4', 804, u'you know, actually some- some of you guys know my history, right? '), ('./static/3.mp4', 806, u'So, you know, I worked at Stanford for a long time. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 808, u'Then, um, I started as leading the Google Brain Team which, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 812, u'uh, did a lot of projects at Google and I think the Google Brain Team the, you know, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 815, u'built from scratch was arguably the leading force for, um, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 819, u'helping Google go from what was already '), ('./static/3.mp4', 821, u'a great Internet company into today a great AI company. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 825, u'Um, and then, uh, did something similar, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 828, u'Baidu in China or its Chine- you know, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 830, u'which was headquartered in China which kind of helped Baidu '), ('./static/3.mp4', 833, u'go from al- also what was already a great company into today. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 837, u"You know, many people say China's is greatest AI company. "), ('./static/3.mp4', 840, u'Um, and I think through work on many projects at Google, many projects at Baidu. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 844, u'And now leading Landing AI helping many companies on many projects '), ('./static/3.mp4', 848, u'and running around to different companies and '), ('./static/3.mp4', 849, u'see many different machine learning projects they have. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 852, u"I think I've been fortunate to learn a lot of lessons, um, "), ('./static/3.mp4', 856, u'not just about the technical aspects of machine learning, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 859, u'but about the practical know-how aspects of machine learning. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 862, u'And, um, if you, uh, uh, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 866, u'and- and I think that, uh, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 867, u'what you can learn from, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 870, u'um, you know, the Internet or from a purely academic sources or from reading '), ('./static/3.mp4', 875, u'research papers is a lot of the technical aspects of machine learning and deep learning. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 879, u'But, uh, there are a lot of '), ('./static/3.mp4', 881, u'other practical aspects of how to get these algorithms to work that, um, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 885, u'I actually do not know of '), ('./static/3.mp4', 887, u'any other academic course that- that kind of goes into great depth [NOISE] teaching it. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 891, u"Uh, there might be one but I'm- I'm- I'm not sure. "), ('./static/3.mp4', 894, u'But one of the things that, um, uh, uh, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 897, u'we hope to do in this class is to not just give you '), ('./static/3.mp4', 900, u'the tools but also give you the know-how and how to make it work, right? '), ('./static/3.mp4', 904, u'And I think, you know, I actually spent a lot of time thinking about, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 906, u'uh, so actually, uh, uh, late last night, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 908, u'I actually stayed up very late last night reading this new book by, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 911, u'um, John Osahalts on, ah, software architecture. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 915, u'Right. And I think that, um, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 917, u"there's a huge difference between, you know, "), ('./static/3.mp4', 919, u'a junior software engineer and a senior software engineer. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 922, u'Maybe everyone understands the C++ and the Python and the Java Syntax. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 926, u'Yeah, you can get that from- from, uh, from, you know, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 928, u'you just figure out, "Hey, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 929, u'this is how C++ works. This is how Java works. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 931, u'This is how Python NumPy works.". '), ('./static/3.mp4', 933, u"But, um, it's often the high-level judgment decisions, "), ('./static/3.mp4', 938, u'of how you architect the system. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 939, u'Uh, uh, what abstractions do you use? '), ('./static/3.mp4', 942, u'How do you define interfaces? '), ('./static/3.mp4', 943, u'That defines a difference between a really good software engineer versus, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 947, u'you know, a less experienced software engineer. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 949, u"It's not understanding C++ Syntax. "), ('./static/3.mp4', 951, u'Um, and I think in the same way, uh, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 954, u'today there are lots of ways for you to '), ('./static/3.mp4', 956, u'learn the technical tools of machine learning and deep learning. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 960, u'And you will learn that in this class. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 961, u"You know, you'll learn how to train the neural network. "), ('./static/3.mp4', 964, u'You learn the latest optimization algorithms. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 966, u'You, uh, understand deeply what a conv net is. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 969, u'What are, uh, recurrent neural network is. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 971, u'What LSTM is. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 972, u'You- you understand what intention model as '), ('./static/3.mp4', 973, u'you- you learn all of these things in great detail. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 976, u'You work on projects in computer vision, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 977, u'natural language processing, speech and so on. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 979, u'Um, but I think one other thing that is relatively unique, uh, to this class, um, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 984, u'uh, and- and- and to the- I guess the- the- the things you see, uh, on, uh, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 989, u'the deeplearning.ai Coursera websites as well as the things we do in class, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 993, u'is trying to give you '), ('./static/3.mp4', 994, u"the practical know-how so that when you're building a machine learning system, "), ('./static/3.mp4', 998, u'you can be very efficient in, uh, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1000, u'deciding things like, should we collect more data or not, right? '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1004, u'And the answer is not always "Yes". '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1006, u'Uh, I think- I think, um, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1008, u'with- I think that many of us try to '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1011, u'convey the message that having more data is good, right? '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1015, u"And that's actually true. More data pretty much never hurts, "), ('./static/3.mp4', 1017, u'but I think the message of big data has also been '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1020, u"over-hyped and sometimes it's actually not worth your while to go and collect more data. "), ('./static/3.mp4', 1024, u"All right. Uh, but- so when you're working on "), ('./static/3.mp4', 1027, u'machine learning project and if you are either do it by yourself or leading a team, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1031, u'your abilities to make a good judgment decision about, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1034, u'should you spend another week collecting more data, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1036, u'or should you spend another week searching for hyperparameters, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1039, u'or tuning parameters in your neural network. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1041, u"That's the type of decision that if you make it correctly, "), ('./static/3.mp4', 1045, u'can easily make your team 2X or 3X or maybe 10X more efficient. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1049, u'And so one thing we hope to do in this class is to more '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1053, u'systematically impart to you this- this type of knowledge. All right. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1058, u'And so I think, um, uh, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1061, u'e- even today, um, I, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1063, u'you know, actually- I actually visited lots of, uh, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1065, u'machine learning teams around Silicon Valley and around the world and I kinda '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1068, u"see what they're doing and [NOISE] um, you know, "), ('./static/3.mp4', 1071, u'recently I visited a company that had a team of, uh, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1075, u'30 people trying to build a learning algorithm '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1078, u'and the team of about 30 people was '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1080, u'working on a learning algorithm for about three months. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1082, u'Right. And- and they had not yet managed to get it to work. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1084, u"So they're basically, you know, uh, you know, "), ('./static/3.mp4', 1086, u'not succeeded after 3 months. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1088, u'Um, one of my colleagues [OVERLAPPING] have the datasets. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1092, u'[OVERLAPPING] Oh, Kian?

'), ('./static/3.mp4', 1101, u'[LAUGHTER] All right. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1104, u'Um, so, uh, one of my colleagues, um, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1107, u'took the dataset home and spent one weekend working on it. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1111, u"[LAUGHTER] Let's see what you're doing now. "), ('./static/3.mp4', 1113, u'[NOISE] All right. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1117, u'Cool.

'), ('./static/3.mp4', 1133, u"So, what's that? That's like a, uh, "), ('./static/3.mp4', 1135, u"I don't know, that's more than a 10x difference in- in speed, right? "), ('./static/3.mp4', 1138, u'And- and a lot of the differences between the great machine learning teams versus '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1142, u'less experienced ones is actually not just do you know how to, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1146, u'you know, implement, uh, um, uh, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1149, u"it's not just do you know how to implement an LSTM, "), ('./static/3.mp4', 1152, u'right, in- in Tensorflow flow or Keras or whatever? '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1155, u"You have to know that but it's actually other things as well. "), ('./static/3.mp4', 1158, u'And I think, um, Kian and I and the teaching team are looking forward '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1162, u'to trying to systematically impart to you a lot of this know-how so that, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1166, u"uh, when- hopefully someday when you're all leading "), ('./static/3.mp4', 1169, u'a team of machine learning engineers or- or '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1171, u"deep learning engineers that you could help direct the team's efforts more efficiently. "), ('./static/3.mp4', 1175, u'Um, and oh, and actually if any of you are interested, uh, uh, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1180, u"one of the things I've been- actually, "), ('./static/3.mp4', 1184, u'how many of you have heard of Machine Learning Yearning? '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1187, u'Machine Learning Yearning? Wow, almost none of you. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1189, u'Okay. Interesting. Um, so this is, uh, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1192, u'if this is your first Machine Learning class, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1194, u'this may be too advanced for you. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1196, u"But if you've had a little bit of other machine learning background, um, "), ('./static/3.mp4', 1199, u"Machine Learning Yearning is a book that I've been- I've been working on.

'), ('./static/3.mp4', 1219, u'And so, uh, if you go to this website, uh, uh, you know, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1222, u'this website will send you- actually I just finished '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1225, u'the last- just finished the whole book draft last weekend. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1229, u'Uh, uh, and so email allows students. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1231, u'If you want a copy, go to the website '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1233, u"and enter your email address and I'll make sure that, "), ('./static/3.mp4', 1235, u"you know, when we send out the book- actually it might be later today, I'm not sure.

'), ('./static/3.mp4', 1252, u'Um, and I think this will- and- and I think this class will '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1256, u'talk a lot about a lot of the other principles of Machine Learning Yearning, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1258, u'but give you much more practice as well than- than just reading a book might. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1262, u"Um, so [NOISE] let's see. "), ('./static/3.mp4', 1269, u'Okay.

'), ('./static/3.mp4', 1286, u"I- it's a, you know, co-founded Coursera, "), ('./static/3.mp4', 1287, u'worked in education for a long time. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1288, u'So I spent a long time really thinking a lot about '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1291, u'education and I think CS230 represents, you know, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1295, u'Kian and my- and our teaching teams, uh, uh, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1298, u'really best attempt to deliver a great, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1300, u'uh, on-campus deep learning course. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1303, u'Um, and so, oh, interesting. [LAUGHTER] Um- '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1309, u'Um, and so the format of this class is, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1313, u"um, what's called the flipped classroom class. "), ('./static/3.mp4', 1316, u'And what that means is that, so, you know, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1319, u"and I think, uh, I've taught on SCPD for a long time, right? "), ('./static/3.mp4', 1322, u'For, you know, many, many years I guess. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1324, u'And I found that, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1325, u'uh, even for classes, uh, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1327, u'like CS229 or other Stanford courses, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1329, u'often students end up, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1331, u'you know, uh, watching videos at home. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1333, u'Uh, and, and I think with the flipped classroom what we realized was if '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1337, u'many students are watching videos of these lectures at home anyway, um, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1342, u"why don't we spend a lot of effort to produce higher-quality videos, "), ('./static/3.mp4', 1347, u'uh, that you can watch, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1348, u'that are more time-efficient for you to watch at home. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1351, u'Um, and so our, our team, uh, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1353, u'created videos, uh, deeplearning.ai created, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1356, u'you know, kind of the best videos we knew how to create it on deep learning, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1359, u'uh, that, uh, are now hosted on Coursera. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1362, u'And so, with- I, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1363, u"I actually think that it'll be, uh, uh, "), ('./static/3.mp4', 1366, u'quite time-efficient for you to watch those videos, um, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1369, u'do the online programming exercises, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1372, u'do the online, uh, uh, quizzes. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1374, u'And what that does is it preserves the class time of '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1377, u'both the weekly sessions that we meet right here on Wednesdays, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1380, u'as well as the TA discussion sections on Fridays for '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1383, u'much deeper interactions and for much deeper discussions. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1387, u'And so, um, the format of the class is that we ask you to, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1392, u'uh, you know, do the online content, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1394, u'uh, created by deeplearning.ai hosted on Coursera, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1396, u'and then in class, uh, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1398, u'both the meetings with Kian and me- I think '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1401, u'Kian and I will split the sessions roughly 50-50, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1403, u'uh, as well as for the deeper small group discussion sections you have with the TAs.

'), ('./static/3.mp4', 1421, u'And, uh, that will also give us more opportunities to give you, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1425, u'um, advanced material, uh, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1427, u"that goes beyond what's hosted online, as well as, "), ('./static/3.mp4', 1430, u'um, uh, uh, give you additional practice with these concepts, right? '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1436, u"Um, and so let's see. "), ('./static/3.mp4', 1441, u'Yeah. And so, um, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1443, u"I've also finished up with, uh, uh, "), ('./static/3.mp4', 1445, u"two more thoughts, and then I'll hand it over to Kian. "), ('./static/3.mp4', 1448, u'Um, I think, you know, uh, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1452, u'machine learning, deep learning, AI, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1453, u"whatever, it's changing a lot of industries, right?

'), ('./static/3.mp4', 1475, u'I- imagine going to a hospital today that has no electricity, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1478, u'and how do you- how do you even do that, right? '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1479, u'Without computers, medical devices, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1481, u'how you even run a healthcare system.

'), ('./static/3.mp4', 1487, u'So, much of communications really needs electricity, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1490, u'but electricity transformed every major industry. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1492, u'And I think machine learning and '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1494, u'deep learning has reached a level of maturity where we see '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1497, u'a surprisingly clear path for it to also transform pretty much every industry.

'), ('./static/3.mp4', 1516, u'Um, and I think, you know, after this class, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1519, u"I hope that you'll be well-qualified to, like, "), ('./static/3.mp4', 1521, u'get a job in some of the big shiny tech companies that have, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1525, u'uh, a large AI teams. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1527, u'Um, I think a lot of the most exciting work to be done today is still, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1530, u'is to go into the less shiny industries that do not yet have, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1534, u'um, AI and machine learning yet and to take it to those areas. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1539, u'Actually, on the way in, I was chatting with a student, um, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1541, u'that works in cosmology who was commenting, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1544, u'was that you? No, sorry. Who has it? '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1545, u'So- oh, at the back, who was commenting that '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1547, u'cosmology needs more machine learning, right?

"), ('./static/3.mp4', 1566, u"And I think that- but I think- and I think it's great "), ('./static/3.mp4', 1568, u'that we have those great AI teams like Google Brain, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1570, u"Baidu AI group, other large tech companies have great AI teams and that's wonderful. "), ('./static/3.mp4', 1574, u'I think a lot of the important work to be done, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1576, u'that I hope many of you will do, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1578, u'is to take AI to healthcare, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1579, u'take AI to computational biology, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1580, u'take AI to civil engineering, take AI to the mechanical engineering. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1582, u'I think all of this is worth doing. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1584, u"Um, just like electricity didn't have one killer app, "), ('./static/3.mp4', 1587, u"it's useful for a lot of things. "), ('./static/3.mp4', 1589, u'And I think, uh, uh, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1590, u'many of you will go out after this class and execute many exciting projects, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1594, u'both in tech companies and in, you know, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1596, u'other areas that, that- like, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1598, u'like, like cosmology, right? '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1600, u'Uh, or other areas that were not traditionally considered, um, CS areas. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1606, u'Um, so, uh, just wrap up with, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1610, u'uh, uh, uh, two last thoughts. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1614, u'Um, I think that, uh, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1618, u"one of the things that excites me these days is I'm hoping, "), ('./static/3.mp4', 1622, u'uh, you know, I, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1624, u'I wanna share with you one of the lessons I learned, right? '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1627, u'Uh, watching the rise of AI in multiple companies and spent lot of time thinking about, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1632, u'you know, what is it that makes a great AI company. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1636, u'And one of the lessons I learned, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1638, u'um, was really, uh, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1639, u'hearing Jeff Bezos speak about what is it that makes for an internet company, right? '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1644, u'And I think a lot of lessons, um, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1645, u'that we learned with the rise of the Internet will be useful, you know, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1649, u'and Internet was maybe one of the last major technological ways of disruption. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1653, u'And just as it has a great time to start working on the Internet maybe 20 years ago. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1658, u'I think today is a great time to start working on AI or deep learning. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1661, u'And so, is there a way to turn on the lights on this side as well? '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1665, u'Do I- do I control that? '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1667, u'[NOISE] Oh, thank you. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1671, u'Oh, thanks again. Great. So, so, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1673, u'I wanna show you one of the lessons I learned. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1675, u'Really, spend lot of time trying to understand '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1677, u'the rise of the Internet because they will be useful to many of '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1680, u'you as you navigate the rise of machine learning AI in your upcoming careers as well. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1685, u'Which is, um, one of the lessons I learned was, uh, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1689, u'you can take your favorite shopping mall and build a website for the shopping mall. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1698, u'That does not turn your shopping mall into an Internet company, right? '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1707, u'So, you know, uh, like my wife, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1709, u'like Stanford Shopping Center, uh, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1710, u'uh, and I, I, I, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1712, u'and Stanford Shopping Center has a website. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1714, u'But even if, you know, a great shopping mall sells stuff on a website, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1717, u"there's a huge difference between a shopping mall with a website compared to "), ('./static/3.mp4', 1721, u'a true Internet company like an Amazon or, and, and whatever. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1724, u"So, what's the difference? "), ('./static/3.mp4', 1726, u'Um, about five, six, actually, six, six, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1729, u'seven years ago, I was chatting with the CEO of a very large American retailer. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1734, u'And, uh, at that time, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1735, u'he and his CIO were saying to me, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1738, u'they were saying, "Look, Andrew, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1739, u'we have a website, we sell things on the website, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1742, u'Amazon has a website, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1743, u'Amazon sells things on the website, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1744, u'it\'s the same thing." '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1746, u"But of course it's not. And today, "), ('./static/3.mp4', 1747, u"this particular large American retailer's, you know, "), ('./static/3.mp4', 1749, u'future existence is actually a little bit in question partly, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1752, u'[NOISE] partly because of Amazon. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1754, u'Um, so one of the lessons I learned, um, uh, uh, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1758, u'really variances with Jeff Bezos is that what '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1762, u'defines an Internet company is not just whether you have a website, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1765, u'instead it is, have you organized your team '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1769, u'or your company to do the things that the Internet lets you do really well? '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1773, u'For example, Internet teams, uh, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1775, u'engage in pervasive A/B testing, right? '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1779, u'We, we, we know that we can launch two versions '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1781, u'of the website and just see which one works better, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1783, u'and so we learn much faster. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1785, u'Whereas a traditional shopping mall, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1786, u"you can't launch two shopping malls in "), ('./static/3.mp4', 1788, u'two parallel universes and see which one works better. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1791, u"So, you just- it's just- it's much harder to do that. "), ('./static/3.mp4', 1794, u'Um, we tend to have short shipping times, right? '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1801, u'You can ship a new product every day or every week, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1803, u'and so you learn much faster. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1805, u'Whereas a traditional shopping mall may, uh, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1807, u'redesign the shopping mall once per, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1809, u'once every three months, right? '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1811, u'Uh, and we actually organize our teams differently. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1814, u'Um, we tend to push '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1816, u'decision-making down to the engineers or engineers and product managers. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1825, u'Uh, because in the traditional shopping mall, you know, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1828, u'things kind of move slower, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1830, u'and maybe the CEO says something, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1832, u"and then everyone just does what the CEO says and that's fine. "), ('./static/3.mp4', 1835, u'But in the Internet era, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1837, u'we learned that, um, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1839, u'the technology and the users are so complicated that, uh, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1843, u'only the engineers and the product managers, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1846, u"for those who don't know what that is, uh, "), ('./static/3.mp4', 1847, u'own, are close enough to their technology, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1850, u'to the algorithms and users to make good decisions. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1852, u'And so, we tend to push decision-making power in '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1855, u'Internet companies down to the engineers or engineers and product managers. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1859, u"And you have to do that in the Internet era because that's how you organize "), ('./static/3.mp4', 1864, u'a company or organize a team to do the things '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1866, u'the Internet lets you do really well, right? '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1869, u'So, I think that was the rise of the Internet era. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1873, u'Um, I think with the rise of the AI era or AI machine learning or deep learning, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1878, u'whatever you wanna call it, um, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1880, u"we're learning that if you have, you know, "), ('./static/3.mp4', 1883, u'a traditional company plus '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1886, u'a few neural networks that does '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1892, u'not by itself turn the company to an AI company, right? '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1898, u'And I think what will define the great AI teams of the future, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1904, u'um, uh, will be, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1906, u'do you know how to organize your own work and '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1908, u"organize your team's work to do the things that modern, "), ('./static/3.mp4', 1912, u'you know, machine learning and deep learning and other AI things lets you do really well? '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1917, u'Um, and I think, um, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1919, u"having met AI teams at Google and Baidu I'm a bit biased I think, you know, "), ('./static/3.mp4', 1922, u'Google and Baidu are great and ahead of many other companies in thinking this through. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1926, u"But I think even the best companies in the world haven't completely figured "), ('./static/3.mp4', 1929, u'out what are the principles by which to organize AI teams. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1932, u'But I think some of them will be that, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1935, u'um, we tend to, um, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1937, u'uh, I think that AI teams tend to be very good at strategic data acquisition. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1947, u'And so, you see AI companies or AI teams, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1951, u'even, even, uh, you know, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1953, u'do things that may not seem like it makes sense and why '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1956, u"do these companies have all these free products, that don't make any money? "), ('./static/3.mp4', 1959, u'Well, some of it is to acquire data that you can monetize through other ways, right? '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1963, u'Uh, through advertising or through learning about users. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1966, u'And so, uh, there are a lot of '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1968, u'data acquisition strategies that at the surface level may not make sense, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1972, u'but actually do make sense if you understand how this can be '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1975, u'married with deep learning algorithms to create value elsewhere. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1978, u'Um, and I think that, uh, uh, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1981, u'AI companies tend to, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1982, u'um, organize data differently. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1989, u'AI teams tend to be very good at putting our data together. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1993, u'I think before the rise of deep learning, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1995, u'many companies have fragmented data warehouses, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 1998, u'where if you have a big company, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2000, u'if you have 50 different databases, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2001, u'you know, in 50 different divisions, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2003, u"it's actually very difficult for an engineer to look at all this data "), ('./static/3.mp4', 2007, u'and put it together and to train a learning algorithm to do something valuable. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2010, u'So, the leading AI companies, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2012, u'tend to have unified data warehouses. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2015, u'And I guess and I, I know we have a large home audience, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2017, u'the SCPD or other home audience here. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2019, u'So, if any of you work in large tech companies, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2022, u'you know, this is something that, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2023, u'that many companies are investing in today, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2026, u'to lay the foundation for learning algorithms. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2029, u'We tend to be very good at spotting pervasive automation opportunities,. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2034, u'Which is very good at spotting opportunities, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2037, u'where you could instead of having people do a task, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2040, u'have a deep learning algorithm do a task or have a different AI algorithm do a task. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2043, u'Um, and we also have a [NOISE] new job descriptions, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2052, u"which I don't have time to talk about. "), ('./static/3.mp4', 2053, u'But just as with the rise of the Internet, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2056, u'we started creating a lot of new roles for engineers, right? '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2059, u'I, I think, actually once upon a time, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2061, u'the world was simple and there was just a Software Engineering title. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2065, u'But as technology gotten- got more complicated, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2068, u'we started to specialize. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2070, u"So that's why, you know, with the Internet, "), ('./static/3.mp4', 2072, u'we have front-end and back-end, mobile, right? '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2074, u'And then we have, you know, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2077, u"and then we're increasingly other roles, right QA, "), ('./static/3.mp4', 2080, u'DevOps, IT with increased specialization of knowledge. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2084, u'And so, with the rise of machine learning, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2086, u"we're starting the creation of new roles like, machine-learning engineer, "), ('./static/3.mp4', 2090, u'resource- Machine Learning Research Scientist, er, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2093, u'and and our Product Managers in IT has also '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2095, u'behave differently than Product Managers in tech companies. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2098, u'And so one of the, um, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2100, u"things we'll revisit a few times throughout "), ('./static/3.mp4', 2103, u"this quarter is- and I don't mean to corporate, "), ('./static/3.mp4', 2106, u'I know that many of you are- some of '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2107, u'the SCPD audience or online audience already working in a company, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2110, u'many of you when you graduate from Stanford will end up '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2113, u'maybe starting your own company or joining an existing company, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2116, u"but I think that's solving a lot of these questions, "), ('./static/3.mp4', 2120, u'of how to organize your teams effectively in the AI era, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2123, u'will help you do more valuable work. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2126, u'And I think to, to, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2129, u'to make one more analogy, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2130, u'you know, I think that, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2132, u'one of the things I hope Kian and I will share with you throughout this quarter is, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2137, u'just as in the software engineering world, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2139, u'it took us a long time to figure out what is Agile development, right? '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2145, u'or what are the pros and cons of, you know, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2147, u'Waterfall model versus Agile? '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2149, u'Or, how do you- what is a Scrum process, right? '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2153, u'Or is code review a good idea? '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2155, u'It seems a good idea to me, right? '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2157, u'But these, these practices after, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2160, u'after programming languages were created or invented or whatever, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2163, u'we still had to figure all these ways to help '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2166, u'individuals and teams write software effectively. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2169, u'And so, if you worked in, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2171, u'you know, high-performing corporate, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2173, u'industrial AI teams using these software engineering practices, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2177, u'everything; code review, to Agile, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2178, u'to, to, to whatever, you know, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2180, u'you know that having a team work effectively '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2183, u'to write software is more than everyone knowing C++ syntax, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2186, u'everyone doing Python syntax. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2188, u'And I think in the machine learning world, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2190, u"we're still in the process of inventing these types of processes. "), ('./static/3.mp4', 2195, u'What is the strong, what is the Agile development, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2198, u"what's the equivalent of code review for developing machine learning algorithms and I "), ('./static/3.mp4', 2202, u'think probably this class more than more than, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2206, u"this class and Machine Learning Yearning more than any other visuals I'm aware of right now. "), ('./static/3.mp4', 2211, u"I think we'll try to systematically teach you these tools so that "), ('./static/3.mp4', 2215, u"you don't just are able to derive a learning algorithm and, "), ('./static/3.mp4', 2219, u"and implement a learning algorithm but that you're actually, you know, "), ('./static/3.mp4', 2223, u'very effective in terms of how you go about building these systems. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2228, u'So last thing before I pass it to Kian is, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2235, u"the other question that I've been asked I guess several times this week now, "), ('./static/3.mp4', 2241, u"that I'll just preemptively answer is, "), ('./static/3.mp4', 2243, u'so, there are multiple machine learning classes going on at Stanford this quarter. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2250, u'So, the other frequently asked question is, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2252, u'which of these classes should you take? '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2254, u'So let me just address that preemptively before someone asks me '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2257, u"because I've been asked twice already in the other two classes this quarter. "), ('./static/3.mp4', 2261, u'So, I think, actually what, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2263, u'what has happened over the last several years in Stanford is, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2266, u'the demand for machine learning education has, you know, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2269, u'been rising dramatically because the majority of CS PhD applicants to Stanford you, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2277, u'are applying to do work in machine learning or applying to do work in AI. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2281, u'And I think all of you can kinda of see that, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2284, u"there's such a shortage of machine learning engineers, right? "), ('./static/3.mp4', 2287, u"And then there's a little bit of, and "), ('./static/3.mp4', 2289, u'I think that shortage will continue for a long time. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2291, u'So I think many people see that. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2292, u'If you become expert in machine learning, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2293, u'there will be great opportunities for you to do meaningful work on campus, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2297, u'to take machine learning to comp-bio or- or cosmology or mechanical or do '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2301, u'great research on campus as well as graduate from Stanford and do very unique work. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2306, u'When I wander around Silicon Valley, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2308, u'I feel like there are so many ideas for great machine learning projects that '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2312, u'exactly zero people seem to be working on '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2314, u"because there just aren't enough machine learning people in the world right now. "), ('./static/3.mp4', 2317, u'So, by learning these skills, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2319, u'you could- you have many opportunities to be the first one '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2322, u'to do something very exciting and meaningful, right. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2325, u'And, and you probably read in '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2328, u'the newspapers about how much money machine learning people make, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2330, u"I'm actually much less more, I actually find that, "), ('./static/3.mp4', 2332, u'I hope a lot you make a lot of money. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2333, u"Perhaps you you personally don't find that that, "), ('./static/3.mp4', 2335, u'you know, as, as exciting. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2337, u"I think that, every time there's a major technological disruption, "), ('./static/3.mp4', 2341, u'it gives us an opportunity to remake large parts of the world. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2344, u'And I hope that, some of you go improve the healthcare system, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2347, u'improve educational system, maybe, you know, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2349, u'see if we can help preserve the smooth functioning of democracy around the world. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2353, u'I think that it, it really your unique skills '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2355, u'in deep learning would give you opportunities to do that. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2358, u'I think hopefully very meaningful work. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2361, u'But because of this massive, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2364, u'massive rise in demand for machine learning education, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2368, u'there are, so for longtime, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2370, u'CS229 machine learning was the core machine learning class at Stanford. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2374, u'And then CS230 is actually the newest, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2379, u'new creation I think. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2381, u"And the other class that we're involved in, "), ('./static/3.mp4', 2384, u'that Eunice and I are involved in this quarter is CS229A. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2389, u'So, um, so if you are trying to decide which of these classes to take, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2393, u'um, I think, I think that these classes are little bit like Pokemon, right? '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2398, u'You really should collect them all [LAUGHTER] [NOISE] But, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2401, u'but, but I think, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2402, u"we've been trying to design these classes "), ('./static/3.mp4', 2404, u'to actually teach different things and not have too much overlap. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2408, u'Uh, uh, And so, there is- uh, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2412, u"so I have seen students take two classes at the same time and that's actually fine. "), ('./static/3.mp4', 2416, u"There's not, the degree of overlap is fine, "), ('./static/3.mp4', 2419, u'that you actually learn different things, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2421, u'if you take any two of these classes at the same time. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2423, u'CS229 is machine learning, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2426, u'is the most mathematical of these classes and we go much more, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2429, u'CS229 goes much more into the mathematical derivations of the algorithms. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2433, u'CS229A is applied machine learning, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2437, u'is much less mathematical but spends a bit more time on the practical aspects. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2442, u'Is actually the easiest on ramp to machine learning as '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2444, u'well as the least mathematical of these classes. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2447, u'CS230 is somewhere in between. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2449, u"It's, it's a bit more, is more mathematical than CS229A, "), ('./static/3.mp4', 2452, u'less mathematical than CS230. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2454, u'But where CS230 focuses on is on deep learning, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2458, u'which is just one small subset of '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2460, u'machine learning but it is the hardest subset of machine learning. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2463, u'Whereas there are a lot of other machine learning algorithms, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2465, u'from your PCA, K-means recommender systems, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2468, u'support vector machines that are also very useful, that I use, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2472, u'you know in my work quite frequently, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2473, u"that we don't teach in CS230 but then it's taught in CS229 and CS229A. "), ('./static/3.mp4', 2479, u'Where, so- so the unique things about CS230 is, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2482, u'it focuses on deep learning. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2483, u"So, I don't know, if you want to list deep learning on your resume, "), ('./static/3.mp4', 2486, u'I guess maybe this is the easiest way to do it, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2488, u"I don't know after. "), ('./static/3.mp4', 2490, u"Again it's not what I tend to optimize for but- but and I think "), ('./static/3.mp4', 2493, u'CS230 goes the deepest in the practical know-how in how to apply these algorithms. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2498, u'And so, uh, and I, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2501, u'I want to set expectations accurately as well, right? '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2503, u"So, what I don't want, "), ('./static/3.mp4', 2505, u'is for you guys to complain in the other quarter that, you know, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2508, u"there wasn't enough math because that's actually not the point. "), ('./static/3.mp4', 2511, u'What has happened in the last decade is, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2513, u'the amount of math you need to be '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2515, u'a great machine learning person has actually decreased, I think. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2518, u'Uh, and I wanted to do less math in CS230 but '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2523, u'spend more time teaching you '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2525, u'the practical know-how of how to actually apply these algorithms, right? '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2528, u'So, um, yeah. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2530, u'and I think 229A is probably the easiest of this class, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2533, u"that's the most technical, this is the most, "), ('./static/3.mp4', 2535, u'most hands-on applied, you do a lot of projects on different, different topics, right? '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2539, u'And I think these courses are often the foundation or '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2542, u'some subset of these are often the foundational course as you would say. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2546, u'Because if you say, learn deep learning, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2549, u'so common sequence for our students is that, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2551, u'you know, learn the foundations '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2553, u'of machine learning, uh, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2555, u'or uh, machine learning or deep learning. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2560, u'So, you have the foundation, uh, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2562, u'first before you go, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2563, u'which then often sets you up to later, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2565, u'go deeper into computer vision or '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2568, u'natural language processing or robotics or deep reinforcement learning. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2572, u'And so common sequencing that, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2574, u'common tactic that Stanford students take is to use these as the foundation. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2578, u"You'll see a bit of everything from computer vision, natural language processing, "), ('./static/3.mp4', 2581, u'speech recognition, you will touch a little bit on self-driving cars. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2584, u'But that gives you the foundation to then decide, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2587, u'do you want to go deeper into natural language processing '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2589, u'or robotics or reinforcement learning or computer vision or something else. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2592, u'So these are common sequencing of classes that students take. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2596, u'Okay. So, um, look forward to spending this quarter with you. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2601, u"Let me just check where there are any quick questions and then I'll "), ('./static/3.mp4', 2604, u'hand it over to Kian. Yeah, go for it.

'), ('./static/3.mp4', 2651, u'So all of you are using learning algorithms probably dozens of '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2654, u'times a day maybe even hundreds of times a day without knowing it.

"), ('./static/3.mp4', 2812, u'So the, uh, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2813, u'so the format of the class is that you watch, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2816, u'uh, videos created by deeplearning.ai and hosted on Coursera. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2821, u"So you'll see me a lot there. "), ('./static/3.mp4', 2823, u'But in addition Kian and I, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2826, u'will be having lectures here in this classroom every Wednesday, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2830, u'and that will be, you know, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2832, u'completely new material that is not online anywhere. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2836, u'At least right now. Yeah- yeah. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2838, u'And then also the- I think that, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2841, u'tha- that the point- the point of that the flip classroom thing really is some of '), ('./static/3.mp4', 2844, u'the things is really more time efficient for you to just learn online.

'), ('./static/3.mp4', 2862, u'Right, so there is the Coursera DIY Coursera content.

Yeah, here it is. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 3464, u'Okay. [NOISE] Okay, a few other projects, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 3472, u'uh, one- two weeks from now, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 3475, u'you will build an optimal goalkeeper shoot prediction.

'), ('./static/3.mp4', 3629, u'Machine translation is a- is one of the application '), ('./static/3.mp4', 3634, u'that has been tremendously performing well, uh, with deep learning. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 3639, u"You're going to implement not a full machine translation from one language to another, "), ('./static/3.mp4', 3644, u'but a similar task that is as exciting, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 3647, u'which is, uh, changing human-readable dates to machine-readable dates. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 3651, u"So, you know, let's say you're, you're, you're, "), ('./static/3.mp4', 3654, u"you're filling in a form and you're typing a date. "), ('./static/3.mp4', 3656, u'The, the entity that, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 3658, u'that gathers this data will have '), ('./static/3.mp4', 3660, u'a hard time convert all these dates into a specific format.

'), ('./static/3.mp4', 3674, u'Finally, trigger word detection that I also love and, and some of you have, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 3679, u'have seen us build this algorithm, uh, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 3681, u'a year ago I believe, which was- which Eunice and, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 3684, u'and Andrew and I have, have worked on. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 3687, u'Um, trigger word detection is the problem of detecting a single word. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 3691, u'So, you know, you, you probably have, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 3693, u'uh, objects from big, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 3696, u'uh, companies that detect the voice and activate themselves under a trigger word. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 3700, u"You're going to build this algorithm for the trigger word "), ('./static/3.mp4', 3703, u'activate and many more projects that you will see. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 3709, u'Now, these are the things that you will all build in this course. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 3713, u'Every one of you will build it through programming assignments. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 3716, u'But you also have to choose your own projects to work on throughout the course. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 3720, u'And these are examples of projects that CS230 students have, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 3723, u'have built in the past and which have wor- worked very well. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 3728, u'One is coloring black and white pictures using '), ('./static/3.mp4', 3730, u'a neural network into the color representation of these pictures. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 3734, u"So, it's pretty cool because we can now watch, "), ('./static/3.mp4', 3736, u'uh, movies that were, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 3738, u"that were filmed in the 1930s or 1950s or I don't know when, "), ('./static/3.mp4', 3743, u'uh, in color, which is super cool. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 3746, u'Predicting a price of an object from a picture. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 3749, u'So, this was a great project in the first iteration of CS230 where you '), ('./static/3.mp4', 3753, u'give it a bike and the neural network guesses how much is the bike. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 3758, u"So, if you wanna sell stuff you don't know how much, "), ('./static/3.mp4', 3760, u'you just give it then you sell it at the, at the price. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 3764, u'Uh, the student had actually implemented an algorithm to '), ('./static/3.mp4', 3768, u'see which features of the bike are related to the price. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 3772, u"So, it was super fun to see if it's "), ('./static/3.mp4', 3774, u"the steering wheel or if it's the wheels or if it's the body of "), ('./static/3.mp4', 3777, u"the bike that's makes this bike expensive according to the algorithm, and many more. "), ('./static/3.mp4', 3782, u'So, last quarter, specifically, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 3784, u'we had a lot of projects, uh, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 3786, u'in physics and, uh, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 3788, u'and astrophysics and chemical engineering and mechanics, which was great. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 3792, u'Uh, some examples are detecting earthquake precursors signals with a sequence model. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 3798, u'Um, predicting the atom energy-based on the atomic structure of an atom. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 3803, u'So, you have, you have, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 3805, u'for instance, softwares that run, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 3807, u'that are really computationally expensive that look at '), ('./static/3.mp4', 3810, u'the atomic structure of an atom and will output the energy of this atom.

'), ('./static/3.mp4', 3864, u'And I guess Andrew can, can, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 3866, u'can confirm that CS229 students from '), ('./static/3.mp4', 3869, u'the few past years have done projects that are amazing today and have been featured, '), ('./static/3.mp4', 3875, u'uh, around the world in- as a researcher or, or industrial project. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 3879, u'So, to sum up, in this course you will build a wide range of applications. '), ('./static/3.mp4', 3885, u"Uh, it's very applied. "), ('./static/3.mp4', 3887, u'There is some math but less than CS229 more than CS229A.
