[('./static/1.mp4', 6, u'Welcome. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 7, u'This is CS183F, thank you all for coming, we hope to make a really great class. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 12, u"So, we're going to try to teach you what you need to know for the first 100 days "), ('./static/1.mp4', 17, u'of a startup, basically how do you go from a very raw idea to a company. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 22, u"I'm the president of Y Combinator, I'm Sam Altman, I've been teaching these "), ('./static/1.mp4', 26, u"people for a while and so hopefully, we'll be able to make this make a lot of sense. "), ('./static/1.mp4', 32, u'Today our guest speaker besides me is Dustin Moskovitz. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 36, u'Dustin was the co-founder of Facebook and CTO MVP engineering, I just learned. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 43, u'And is now the co-founder and CEO of Asana. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 45, u'Dustin give a talk at the first person of this class that is still the one I refer '), ('./static/1.mp4', 49, u'other people to the most. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 50, u"And it's about a why to start a startup, which is "), ('./static/1.mp4', 53, u"actually a really important question and one that people don't think about enough. "), ('./static/1.mp4', 56, u'So, he was kind enough to come back and do that again. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 61, u">> [APPLAUSE] >> So, if you're here today, "), ('./static/1.mp4', 64, u"you're watching the video later, you're probably planning to start a company. "), ('./static/1.mp4', 67, u"That's why you're taking the course. "), ('./static/1.mp4', 69, u'Most of the class is going to be about how to go about doing that and '), ('./static/1.mp4', 71, u'achieving success. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 72, u'But, before you dive into the how of being entrepreneur, '), ('./static/1.mp4', 74, u"I'm here to help you think about the why. "), ('./static/1.mp4', 77, u"So, it's important to know which reason is yours, so "), ('./static/1.mp4', 80, u'that you think through the decision correctly, so '), ('./static/1.mp4', 82, u'I hear a variety of common motivators from potential entrepeneurs. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 86, u'But, I found that once they fully considered the trade off, '), ('./static/1.mp4', 88, u"they often decided starting a company isn't actually the best way to achieve "), ('./static/1.mp4', 91, u'their goals. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 93, u"So, I'll hope you make sure you're choosing the best solution. "), ('./static/1.mp4', 95, u'And, I also explain the reason I like to hear best from people about why '), ('./static/1.mp4', 97, u"they want to start a company, what I hear when I think someone's really set up for "), ('./static/1.mp4', 100, u'success. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 102, u"So, I've given this talk before, as Sam said. "), ('./static/1.mp4', 104, u'And a bunch of people have come up to me after and '), ('./static/1.mp4', 105, u'said it really helped them with their decision. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 107, u"In a few cases, they decided that they shouldn't start a company, "), ('./static/1.mp4', 110, u'that they should join an established one. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 112, u"But, I know a lot of you are resolved on what you're doing. "), ('./static/1.mp4', 115, u"If that's true, no problem. "), ('./static/1.mp4', 116, u"I think this will still be useful for you because you'll get a better sense "), ('./static/1.mp4', 119, u"of the reality of what you're about to go through. "), ('./static/1.mp4', 121, u"So it's not a long talk. "), ('./static/1.mp4', 123, u"It's just about ten slides and I've left some time for questions at the end. "), ('./static/1.mp4', 128, u"Great. So it's called Spade to Spade. "), ('./static/1.mp4', 131, u'A lot of people become entrepreneurs specifically as a way to try to become '), ('./static/1.mp4', 134, u'extremely wealthy. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 136, u'So, they see themselves starting the next Facebook, or Google. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 140, u'However, the odds of being, that successful, are actually incredibly small. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 144, u'So, only a handful of an entire generation of companies, '), ('./static/1.mp4', 146, u'actually end up getting to, that scale. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 149, u"So, here's a funnel from the CBN site actually. "), ('./static/1.mp4', 151, u'It shows how many seed funded '), ('./static/1.mp4', 154, u'tech companies get through each round of funding. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 157, u'So, even if we reduce our ambitions a bit to becoming unicorns, so a company with '), ('./static/1.mp4', 160, u'a billion dollar evaluation, we still have incredibly long odds. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 162, u'So, only 1% of seed funded companies get all the way through this funnel. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 167, u'Now, getting to six rounds of funding, '), ('./static/1.mp4', 168, u"it's not exactly the same as becoming unicorn, but it's pretty well correlated. "), ('./static/1.mp4', 171, u'Most of the unicorns I know, had to have at least that many rounds of funding. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 175, u'So, to get there you have to have a truly great idea. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 177, u"It's got to be unique, defensible, going after a large market. "), ('./static/1.mp4', 181, u'You have to execute it Oop, sorry. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 183, u'You have to execute extremely well so that means you have to work hard, '), ('./static/1.mp4', 186, u'you have to attract the right people and '), ('./static/1.mp4', 187, u'you have to have a better strategy than your competitors. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 191, u'And you also have to just be really, really lucky. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 192, u"because there's a lot of things that can get in your way and "), ('./static/1.mp4', 194, u'a lot of them are not even in your control. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 198, u'So, I talked too much of investors and entrepreneurs, and '), ('./static/1.mp4', 201, u"the sense is it's actually getting harder over time we get through this funnel. "), ('./static/1.mp4', 203, u'So, not only are more people starting companies, '), ('./static/1.mp4', 206, u'we need to have more people to compete with. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 208, u"But they're becoming more expensive to operate for a lot of reasons, "), ('./static/1.mp4', 210, u'particularly here in the bay area. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 212, u'And investors have higher expectations too so '), ('./static/1.mp4', 214, u'you have seen valuation multiples start to decline particularly on the public market. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 219, u"Perhaps most importantly it's becoming harder to disrupt incumbents. "), ('./static/1.mp4', 222, u"They're not the slow moving giants that they were ten or twenty years ago. "), ('./static/1.mp4', 225, u'They know how to take advantage of their market position. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 229, u"Some of you are thinking sure it's hard but you get so much more equity as "), ('./static/1.mp4', 233, u"a founder, that it's clearly the only way to make a lot of money. "), ('./static/1.mp4', 236, u"So, let's talk about two different ways you might get to a great "), ('./static/1.mp4', 239, u'financial outcome. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 241, u"So story one, you're the founder, you started a company that does Uber for "), ('./static/1.mp4', 246, u'pet sitting. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 247, u'So, in this picture this is the customer not the founder. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 252, u"It's a great idea and "), ('./static/1.mp4', 253, u'you executed it well, so you sell the company at some point for $100 million. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 256, u"And if you've been really successful limiting dilution, your equity might be "), ('./static/1.mp4', 260, u'as high as 10% of the company at that point by the time it becomes liquid. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 263, u"So, you're walking away with $10 million. "), ('./static/1.mp4', 264, u'Pretty great outcome. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 267, u'However, I just showed you only a small portion of starters that make it that far, '), ('./static/1.mp4', 269, u'so this is the lucky case. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 270, u"$100 million a little easier than $1 billion but it's still extremely rare. "), ('./static/1.mp4', 276, u"And it's actually most likely that you end up with nothing on this path, "), ('./static/1.mp4', 279, u'because you just end up shutting down the company for whatever reason. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 282, u'And oftentimes you see a company sell to an acquirer this kind of range evaluation. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 288, u'In a lot of those cases, '), ('./static/1.mp4', 289, u'the founder still ends up with nothing because of investor liquidity preference. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 293, u"So, it depends a lot on how much money you've raised to get there. "), ('./static/1.mp4', 297, u'So this is definitely the high risk path. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 299, u'But another way to make a similar amount of money, so join a later stage company '), ('./static/1.mp4', 303, u'and help them scale from say 500 million evaluation to 20 billion. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 307, u'So, even straight out college, '), ('./static/1.mp4', 309, u'you can do really well financially by joining a company at that stage. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 312, u'But, especially if you have few years of experience, '), ('./static/1.mp4', 314, u"you're going to get a really good options package and "), ('./static/1.mp4', 316, u"you'll going to have a very high salary too. "), ('./static/1.mp4', 317, u'So, I just sort of swag five basis point here, if you joined earlier '), ('./static/1.mp4', 321, u'might be more than that, if you have more experience it might be more than, but '), ('./static/1.mp4', 325, u'this is a good sort of benchmark. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 328, u'And you probably know the market for experienced tech workers is '), ('./static/1.mp4', 332, u'extremely competitive right now, particularly for product roles. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 336, u'If you choose well, '), ('./static/1.mp4', 337, u'you can also walk away with ten million dollars by taking this path. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 339, u'And if you choose really well, and you do find that next Facebook or Google, '), ('./static/1.mp4', 342, u"while it's still not yet a unicorn, you can do extremely well. "), ('./static/1.mp4', 345, u'So, the 100th engineer at Facebook had a way better financial outcome '), ('./static/1.mp4', 348, u'than the vast majority of entrepreneurs. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 351, u"So, of course, it's still possible you'll choose the wrong company. "), ('./static/1.mp4', 354, u"Won't grow enough, for this kind of outcome. "), ('./static/1.mp4', 355, u'This is actually 40x growth, which is pretty impressive. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 358, u'But the key is, you get to join it much later in its life cycle. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 360, u'So you have a lot more information. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 362, u'You can see the performance so far, '), ('./static/1.mp4', 363, u'you can meet some of the team, you can understand the competitive landscape. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 368, u"And even if you don't find a company that's going to grow this much, "), ('./static/1.mp4', 370, u"you've got a good chance of picking one that's going to grow some. "), ('./static/1.mp4', 372, u"In fact your equity value's probably already non-zero. "), ('./static/1.mp4', 375, u"So, you've got a pretty good chance of having a positive outcome in that "), ('./static/1.mp4', 378, u'situation and maybe a really great outcome. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 380, u"And then finally, if you've found a company, you have a long-term commitment. "), ('./static/1.mp4', 383, u"There's a good chance you're going to be putting ten years or "), ('./static/1.mp4', 385, u'more into making it scale, and you still may fail in the end. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 389, u'Where as if you join an established company, you can work there for '), ('./static/1.mp4', 392, u"a couple years, you can get a sense of whether it's growing. "), ('./static/1.mp4', 395, u'If not you can easily leave and try again. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 397, u'So, you can actually work for several different ones in that same '), ('./static/1.mp4', 399, u'ten year period, and that really increases your chances of a homerun. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 404, u'So, the ultimate takeaway here is there are multiple ways to get a great '), ('./static/1.mp4', 407, u"financial outcome, but it's a lot lower risk to join an established company. "), ('./static/1.mp4', 412, u"Don't worry, not all of these will be arguments about why your should join "), ('./static/1.mp4', 414, u'an established company. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 416, u'[LAUGH] So similarly, '), ('./static/1.mp4', 418, u'a lot of people want to start a company in order to maximize their impact. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 421, u'So usually, financial outcomes are pretty well correlated with that, so '), ('./static/1.mp4', 424, u'a lot of the arguments that I made apply here as well. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 427, u"But when you join a company that's already established, you get some big advantages. "), ('./static/1.mp4', 431, u'So you get to access their existing user base. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 433, u'It might be hundreds of billions, sometimes a billion people. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 436, u"You get the ability to work on top of infrastructure that's already been "), ('./static/1.mp4', 439, u'built out and scaled. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 441, u"And you're collaborating with an established team. "), ('./static/1.mp4', 443, u"So, they're going to help you succeed. "), ('./static/1.mp4', 446, u'So I want to give some concrete examples of massive impact that people achieved '), ('./static/1.mp4', 449, u'as an employee. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 451, u"So, Bret Taylor, who's the head of Quip, before he became an entrepreneur, "), ('./static/1.mp4', 456, u'he joined Google after, it already had over 1,000 employees. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 459, u'And there, he was able to spearhead the creation of Google Maps, '), ('./static/1.mp4', 461, u'which is used by hundreds of millions of people, including me on my way here today. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 466, u'Similarly my co-founder of Asana, Justin Rosenstein, '), ('./static/1.mp4', 469, u'he joined Google at the similar time and there he prototyped Gchat inside Gmail. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 474, u'This was over ten years ago, still used by a ton of people. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 479, u'And then shortly after that, he went to Facebook, after he had a few hundred '), ('./static/1.mp4', 483, u'employees, and he led the Hackathon project that created the Like button. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 486, u'Some of you have probably used it once or twice. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 490, u'So, you can still join teams at Facebook and Google today, and '), ('./static/1.mp4', 494, u'work on something that literally might reach a billion people. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 496, u'Set a lot of impact, even if your '), ('./static/1.mp4', 499, u'contributions are relatively a small portion of the product surface area. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 502, u'So, if you want to become an entrepreneur and maximize impact, these are the types '), ('./static/1.mp4', 505, u'of stories that I think you should be comparing opportunity to. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 510, u"So next there's lifestyle, so "), ('./static/1.mp4', 513, u"everyone's got their own story about what it means to be an entrepreneur. "), ('./static/1.mp4', 517, u'So in general, the media likes to make it seem glamorous, emphasizing launches, and '), ('./static/1.mp4', 521, u'funding milestones. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 523, u'They tend to talk about success cases and ignore failures. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 526, u'And the entrepreneurs, themselves, are like ducks. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 528, u"They're calm on the surface, but they're paddling like hell underneath. "), ('./static/1.mp4', 531, u'But you only get to see them on that surface, looking passionate and focused. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 536, u'So the first image here is from The Social Network, '), ('./static/1.mp4', 539, u'which is a fictional movie about the founding of Facebook. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 542, u'It looks pretty fun, and '), ('./static/1.mp4', 544, u'the last image is an actual photo from the founding of Facebook [LAUGH]. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 548, u"They're a little different. "), ('./static/1.mp4', 549, u'So, reality is a lot of heads down time doing hard work. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 553, u'We hardly had any time to bust open champagne and '), ('./static/1.mp4', 555, u'spray it all over our laptops. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 557, u'>> [LAUGH] >> All right, so in practice, '), ('./static/1.mp4', 565, u'tech is a little less like The Social Network, and more like Silicon Valley. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 568, u"It's actually really stressful. "), ('./static/1.mp4', 570, u'So why is that? '), ('./static/1.mp4', 571, u'Well, a few reasons. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 572, u'One, your team is relying on you, so '), ('./static/1.mp4', 574, u"they're betting some of their best years on the story you've told them. "), ('./static/1.mp4', 577, u'And the recruiters pinging them constantly many times a week. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 580, u"So you're always worried you're going to lose them. "), ('./static/1.mp4', 582, u'Each round of fundraising feels a little like life and death, and '), ('./static/1.mp4', 585, u'your competitors are actually trying to kill you. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 587, u"And you always feel stretched thin, because it's hard to make time for "), ('./static/1.mp4', 590, u"the company, you're significant other, your family, and yourself. "), ('./static/1.mp4', 594, u"So of course, my title here is reference to Ben Horowitz's book, "), ('./static/1.mp4', 597, u'The Hard Thing About Hard Things. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 598, u'If you want to go way deep on this subject, '), ('./static/1.mp4', 600, u'I definitely recommend giving that a read. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 604, u'So relatedly, people also think being a founder will give you control over how you '), ('./static/1.mp4', 608, u'spend your time. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 609, u"Here's a great quote from Phil Libin here, give you a sec to read it. "), ('./static/1.mp4', 618, u'So, Phil and I both learned this the hard way, but '), ('./static/1.mp4', 620, u"you don't actually have control in practice. "), ('./static/1.mp4', 623, u"So, I spend most of my time working on the problems I just couldn't delegate, "), ('./static/1.mp4', 626, u'reacting to issues that are popping up, or resolving conflicts, and '), ('./static/1.mp4', 630, u"you're always on call. "), ('./static/1.mp4', 631, u'So, it makes it hard to really unplug during a vacation, or on the weekends, and '), ('./static/1.mp4', 635, u"you're role model too. "), ('./static/1.mp4', 637, u'So, if you take your foot off the gas, then so will your team. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 641, u"So that said, this one really doesn't apply if you want to have a lifestyle "), ('./static/1.mp4', 645, u"business, you'd be like a small business entrepreneur. "), ('./static/1.mp4', 647, u'If you do that, then you actually do have a lot of control over your lifestyle, but '), ('./static/1.mp4', 651, u'the financial and impact outcomes are going to be smaller. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 655, u'All right, so this is a recap of those first four topics. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 659, u'So these are the top reasons I usually hear from people. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 662, u"So the success funnel that I showed you in practice suggests that startups aren't "), ('./static/1.mp4', 666, u'clearly the best way to maximize financial impacts, sorry, '), ('./static/1.mp4', 670, u'financial reward or impacts. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 671, u'So you might do better by joining an established company. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 674, u'And then similarly, '), ('./static/1.mp4', 675, u"the reality of entrepreneurship doesn't usually match what you see on the media. "), ('./static/1.mp4', 679, u'So, if you want to aim for a home run, '), ('./static/1.mp4', 681, u'you should feel committed to putting in the many years of effort and discipline '), ('./static/1.mp4', 685, u'that it takes to become a professional athlete, and you still may fail [LAUGH]. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 690, u"So now that I've given you a bunch of bad news, "), ('./static/1.mp4', 693, u"let's talk about what I see as the best reason for starting a company. "), ('./static/1.mp4', 697, u"So basically, you can't not do it. "), ('./static/1.mp4', 699, u'So, this has two roots, the first is passion. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 703, u'So passion is really important since we just talked about how hard it '), ('./static/1.mp4', 706, u'is to start a company. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 707, u"So, you're going to need that passion to power through, and "), ('./static/1.mp4', 709, u'you also need it to recruit great people to follow you as a leader. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 713, u"And then, the second part of this is that you're the right person to make this "), ('./static/1.mp4', 715, u'happen by starting a company. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 717, u"So, if you fail to do it you're actually "), ('./static/1.mp4', 719, u'going to be depriving the world of something great. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 721, u'So this implies that the idea itself is really valuable, '), ('./static/1.mp4', 724, u"and it also implies that you're the best person to bring that idea into the world. "), ('./static/1.mp4', 727, u"If you're not the best person, and that best person's out there, and "), ('./static/1.mp4', 730, u"they're probably going to outcompete you, and create something even more valuable. "), ('./static/1.mp4', 734, u"So one twist on this is maybe you're the best person, but "), ('./static/1.mp4', 736, u'you should do it within the context of an existing company. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 739, u'And so, I often feel this way when I hear someone describe something to me that '), ('./static/1.mp4', 742, u'really sounds like a feature of an existing product. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 744, u'So, if you want to have the next twist on photo sharing, I definitely recommend '), ('./static/1.mp4', 748, u'considering Instagram, or Snapchat, and helping them build it into their products. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 752, u'So, you can go entrepreneurial inside the context of an existing company. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 757, u"So I've twice chosen to become an entrepreneur myself, and "), ('./static/1.mp4', 759, u'both of the times were motivated by this reason exactly. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 761, u'So, for Facebook, we actually continue to be students at '), ('./static/1.mp4', 766, u'Harvard until the site had over 100,000 monthly active users.

'), ('./static/1.mp4', 789, u'And that the other people working on it were going to develop incremental '), ('./static/1.mp4', 792, u'solutions, leave a lot of value on the table. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 795, u"So we couldn't stop working on it. "), ('./static/1.mp4', 797, u'Eventually, we decided to leave Facebook, and focus on it full time. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 801, u'So when I meet entrepreneurs that really seem set up for success. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 803, u"This is usually the reason I'm hearing from them. "), ('./static/1.mp4', 805, u"They're starting a company because it felt like really, "), ('./static/1.mp4', 808, u'the only thing that they could do next.

'), ('./static/1.mp4', 869, u'And very related to that I think are just going to be the competitive nature. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 873, u'So, if you have to introduce a whole new photo sharing app, right, and '), ('./static/1.mp4', 876, u'then you have to compete with the distribution and '), ('./static/1.mp4', 879, u"network effects of the existing ones, that's a huge barrier to entry, "), ('./static/1.mp4', 882, u"and there's sort of similar metaphors, and other products.

'), ('./static/1.mp4', 913, u'So I sort of outlined them when I was talking about the funnel. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 916, u'But I definitely think, '), ('./static/1.mp4', 917, u"it's just a lot of more competitive in terms of the other businesses out there, "), ('./static/1.mp4', 921, u"so there's just like most of the valuable markets have interesting players already. "), ('./static/1.mp4', 926, u"And it's also very competitive in the recruiting markets.

'), ('./static/1.mp4', 934, u"So, it's one of the ways that costs have gone up, there's also a bunch of other "), ('./static/1.mp4', 938, u'ways including just like real estate and the really expensive right now. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 942, u'Some other costs have come down like data center costs, but in general, '), ('./static/1.mp4', 947, u'it just feels higher for and harder to get going, yeah?

'), ('./static/1.mp4', 967, u"So, sorry the question is what's the difference between being a sort of "), ('./static/1.mp4', 971, u'a later employee at an established company versus being an early employee? '), ('./static/1.mp4', 975, u'Is that the question? '), ('./static/1.mp4', 977, u'So I think of it as just a spectrum on the risk scale, '), ('./static/1.mp4', 980, u'between founder and 1,000th employee. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 982, u"So if you're in the first 10, you have a little bit more information, "), ('./static/1.mp4', 985, u'you know who the founders are, you know who the leaders are.

'), ('./static/1.mp4', 1057, u'At Facebook, pretty organic so really a lot of people are just like the people in '), ('./static/1.mp4', 1061, u'our network at Harvard that we moved out to Palo Alto west. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 1065, u'And then very early on, we hired Matt Collier and he sort of took over '), ('./static/1.mp4', 1069, u'recruiting and helped us get in networking to Standford actually and '), ('./static/1.mp4', 1072, u'a lot of people we hired were recent graduates here. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 1076, u'And we really focused on the product team first. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 1078, u'But yeah, a lot of it was very path dependent and organic, working networks.

'), ('./static/1.mp4', 1755, u'And almost all start-ups get this wrong. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 1758, u'Eventually what you want of course, '), ('./static/1.mp4', 1760, u'is a lot of users that really love your product.

'), ('./static/1.mp4', 1772, u'And then you can find out how to find more and more of these users and '), ('./static/1.mp4', 1776, u'broaden the appeal of the product. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 1778, u'Or you can have a lot of people that kind of used the product once or twice, '), ('./static/1.mp4', 1781, u'kind of like it and try to figure out how to get them more engaged over time. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 1787, u'With high confidence I can say, '), ('./static/1.mp4', 1788, u'you want to start with a small number of users that really love you. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 1793, u'Almost all great companies have products that start this way. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 1796, u'Think about the ones in your own life, the products that are so '), ('./static/1.mp4', 1798, u"good that you're spontaneous to tell your friends about them. "), ('./static/1.mp4', 1801, u'The products that are so good, '), ('./static/1.mp4', 1803, u'that if they went away you would write the company in protest.

'), ('./static/1.mp4', 1813, u'So, if you have, and in fact, I think this is so important that you actually '), ('./static/1.mp4', 1818, u"shouldn't track absolute growth and number of users in the early days of a startup. "), ('./static/1.mp4', 1822, u"You should just track how often they're using it and "), ('./static/1.mp4', 1825, u"we'll have a session on metrics later. "), ('./static/1.mp4', 1827, u'But you really want to get good at analyzing your metrics and '), ('./static/1.mp4', 1830, u"saying is this a user that I'm retaining and it's using it frequently? "), ('./static/1.mp4', 1834, u'How do I compare to other products in my space? '), ('./static/1.mp4', 1838, u"And that's a good early indicator of users that love you. "), ('./static/1.mp4', 1842, u'Better still is them spontaneously telling their friends to buy your product. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 1846, u'But the important point here is this. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 1849, u'Nothing but a great product will save you. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 1850, u"We're going to talk a lot of other things in this course and "), ('./static/1.mp4', 1853, u'they all kind of matter. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 1854, u"But if you don't get this one right, if you don't make a great product, "), ('./static/1.mp4', 1857, u'the thing is still not going to work. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 1862, u'So, you need to get some users to build a great product. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 1865, u"You can't do this in a vacuum. "), ('./static/1.mp4', 1866, u'You need people to talk to and to iterate with.

'), ('./static/1.mp4', 1874, u'And one of the most common cliches in all of startup advice '), ('./static/1.mp4', 1877, u'is to talk to your users. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 1879, u"One thing I've learned is that most people don't know what that actually means. "), ('./static/1.mp4', 1883, u"Most people will say, I'm supposed to talk to my users, so they call up a user and "), ('./static/1.mp4', 1887, u"say, hey, it's Sam, do you like my product? "), ('./static/1.mp4', 1890, u"And the user says, yeah, I do, it's fine. "), ('./static/1.mp4', 1892, u"People kind of generally don't want to disappoint you. "), ('./static/1.mp4', 1895, u'And so you say, great thanks, and you hang up the phone. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 1898, u'And this is what most founders do when you say talk to your users. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 1902, u'This is not what it means. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 1904, u"Emmett Shear, who's one of our lecturers later, "), ('./static/1.mp4', 1906, u"is really good at doing user interviews and he'll talk about this in more detail. "), ('./static/1.mp4', 1910, u'But you really need to drill in. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 1912, u'And remember, people are going to be too nice to you. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 1914, u'So you need to find out exactly what they like about it. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 1916, u'You need to watch them use it. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 1918, u"You need to try to figure out where they're doing things that seem weird to "), ('./static/1.mp4', 1921, u"you, because they're trying to accomplish something else. "), ('./static/1.mp4', 1923, u'You should ask them, have you recommended this to anyone else? '), ('./static/1.mp4', 1926, u'If not, why not? '), ('./static/1.mp4', 1928, u'Have you paid me yet, if not, why not, what would that take? '), ('./static/1.mp4', 1930, u'You really have to dig in and '), ('./static/1.mp4', 1932, u'talk about specific features, things that used to use instead. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 1935, u'Times when they stopped using your product and use some other product. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 1939, u"The top level questions here don't help you. "), ('./static/1.mp4', 1942, u"In terms of getting those users, everyone things that they're just going to put up "), ('./static/1.mp4', 1946, u"this website tell one persons about it and it's going to take off. "), ('./static/1.mp4', 1948, u"Like wildfire, that's not what usually happens. "), ('./static/1.mp4', 1952, u'So there are four common strategies to get your first hundred users.

'), ('./static/1.mp4', 1968, u'Someone you were friends with in highschool. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 1970, u"You should actually if it's a paid product, you should actually charge. "), ('./static/1.mp4', 1974, u'This is important, remember, people are going to be inclined to do you favors, '), ('./static/1.mp4', 1977, u"they're going to be too nice in what they tell you. "), ('./static/1.mp4', 1979, u"So, if it's a paid project, charge them. "), ('./static/1.mp4', 1982, u'Another strategy is to research people that you think might use your product, and '), ('./static/1.mp4', 1985, u'then email them or whatever and ask them to try it. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 1988, u'Conversion rates here are low, maybe 2%, 3%. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 1990, u"So you'll have to do this to more. "), ('./static/1.mp4', 1992, u'But you can send target emails and say, hey, I just made this new product, '), ('./static/1.mp4', 1995, u"I'd really appreciate it if you would try it out. "), ('./static/1.mp4', 1997, u'Most people, want to be helpful. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 1998, u'They probably will. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 2000, u'You can do social media, Hacker News, forums, press, whatever. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 2005, u'If this is going to be your growth strategy, you need to figure out a way for '), ('./static/1.mp4', 2009, u'it to be ongoing. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 2010, u'Not a one big pop and then go away. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 2012, u'Most people who do this find that it works once. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 2015, u'Then, they call up the journalists and say, will you write about me again. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 2018, u'And the journalist says, anything changed? '), ('./static/1.mp4', 2020, u'No, but I really need users, will you please write? '), ('./static/1.mp4', 2022, u'The journalist still says no. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 2024, u'Air BnB is an example of a company that made this work as an ongoing process. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 2028, u'And they would do the craziest things. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 2030, u'They just kept coming up with press stunt after press stunt. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 2033, u'They would mail journalists giant boxes of cereal so they got on their desk.

"), ('./static/1.mp4', 2041, u'And finally, the laziest and least impressive thing you can do '), ('./static/1.mp4', 2045, u'is to just buy ads on Facebook or Google and point people to your website.

'), ('./static/1.mp4', 2095, u'And this cycle is how you iterate and improve. '), ('./static/1.mp4', 2098, u'The law of compound growth being what it is, '), ('./static/1.mp4', 2100, u'if you can get 2% better every iteration cycle, and you have a chance of having '), ('./static/1.mp4', 2104, u'an iteration cycle be every four hours or every four weeks, and you compound '), ('./static/1.mp4', 2109, u'that over the course of a few years, you get in very, very different places.
