'), ('./static/4.mp4', 22, u"I'm gonna play three roles today. "), ('./static/4.mp4', 26, u'The first role is Emeritus Professor Don Knuth from the 21st century.

"), ('./static/4.mp4', 52, u'A young 31 year old guy named Don Kanuth and '), ('./static/4.mp4', 60, u"that young guy is going to be when I stand here, that's who I am. "), ('./static/4.mp4', 65, u'Okay, so I hope you can understand it. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 68, u'All right now. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 69, u'[COUGH] So this whole thing '), ('./static/4.mp4', 73, u'started with the Stanford has a project going on for some years called Class X. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 77, u'And the people, the idea is to make '), ('./static/4.mp4', 81, u'interesting video stuff to put on YouTube for the future. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 85, u'And so that things that are going on these days at Stanford '), ('./static/4.mp4', 89, u'can be appreciated by people in future generations. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 92, u'So they asked me, would I '), ('./static/4.mp4', 96, u'be able to tape some kind of a presentation for the future? '), ('./static/4.mp4', 101, u'And I said, well I think it would be fun to do something different and '), ('./static/4.mp4', 106, u'that would be to try to repeat the first lecture that I gave '), ('./static/4.mp4', 112, u"after I'd become a professor at Stanford. "), ('./static/4.mp4', 117, u'This was, I had just become my title changed from '), ('./static/4.mp4', 121, u'mathematician to computer scientist. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 126, u'And at that time, as you can see, I wanted to explain what I '), ('./static/4.mp4', 133, u'expected I might be doing the rest of my life to the people around. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 138, u"So, that's the beginning of this talk and so "), ('./static/4.mp4', 143, u'it was November 4th, 1969 that was a Tuesday and '), ('./static/4.mp4', 150, u'in order to be a little bit authentic I went over to the gap and '), ('./static/4.mp4', 154, u'I found out they are selling 1969 blue jeans. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 158, u'>> [LAUGH] >> So I bought myself. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 160, u'>> [LAUGH] >> A blue jean. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 164, u'Okay. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 164, u'Yeah.

"), ('./static/4.mp4', 168, u'>> [LAUGH] >> And '), ('./static/4.mp4', 172, u'the reason is just to help me '), ('./static/4.mp4', 178, u'remember that when I do give the lecture that I speak as much as I can, '), ('./static/4.mp4', 183, u"as I would have spoken in the 60's. "), ('./static/4.mp4', 187, u'Now if you want to see what I really looked like '), ('./static/4.mp4', 193, u"in the lobby of Gates building the first floor there's a really nice historical "), ('./static/4.mp4', 197, u'display that shows that pictures that were taken of John McCarthy, '), ('./static/4.mp4', 203, u'Ed McClowsky, Ed Flaginbaum so on. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 206, u'A lot of Bob Floyd and also you can see some of the students who are writing '), ('./static/4.mp4', 213, u'and trying tear down the computer center and so on, but then you. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 219, u"This was the 60's but "), ('./static/4.mp4', 220, u"actually most of the action of the 60's took place in the 70's, early 70's. "), ('./static/4.mp4', 225, u'Anyways, so 1969. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 227, u'And I also put online '), ('./static/4.mp4', 233, u"some home movies that my wife and I took in the 60's in case "), ('./static/4.mp4', 237, u"you're really interested in seeing what our cat looked like in 1960. "), ('./static/4.mp4', 240, u'>> [LAUGH] >> So now, in order to prepare for this I, '), ('./static/4.mp4', 245, u'by the way I came to Stanford because '), ('./static/4.mp4', 252, u'it was the worlds greatest computer class department by far, by any measure. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 257, u'And I mentioned George Forsythe, the chair, well he had worked '), ('./static/4.mp4', 263, u'very hard all through the sixties to open up this department. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 268, u'This department actually opened up in 1965 and this was '), ('./static/4.mp4', 274, u'the place where I could come and be, have all the great '), ('./static/4.mp4', 281, u'professors in one place instead of having to be isolated somewhere else. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 287, u'So now, in order to get ready for today, '), ('./static/4.mp4', 292, u"I went to Stanford archives, where George's appointment calendar was, and "), ('./static/4.mp4', 299, u'I could look at faculty, minutes of faculty meetings, '), ('./static/4.mp4', 304, u"and so on, and figure out what's going on. "), ('./static/4.mp4', 311, u'I want to mention by the way also that, '), ('./static/4.mp4', 313, u"if anybody deserves the name father of computer science, it's George Forsythe. "), ('./static/4.mp4', 318, u'So this is also, everybody loved him, and he was wonder. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 324, u"Everything that's good about Stanford computer science now is "), ('./static/4.mp4', 330, u'pretty much due to him. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 331, u'So then I also look at the Stanford daily for November 4th, '), ('./static/4.mp4', 336, u'and a few of the other days. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 337, u'And so what was the big news on November 4th? '), ('./static/4.mp4', 340, u'That morning, it said essentially, the previous night, '), ('./static/4.mp4', 347, u'Monday night, the campus was quiet for half an hour while all the students were '), ('./static/4.mp4', 351, u'listening to President Nixon giving a special address about Vietnam. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 357, u'And evidently what Nixon said was that he had a secret plan which was for '), ('./static/4.mp4', 363, u'winning the war in Vietnam. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 366, u'And this was not too well received on campus because vast '), ('./static/4.mp4', 371, u'majority of the students wanted that to be over with and '), ('./static/4.mp4', 376, u'that professors Sandy Dorenbush and Martin Kor were '), ('./static/4.mp4', 380, u'leading a movement called the Vietnam Movement. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 386, u"So there's lot of stuff going on, but "), ('./static/4.mp4', 388, u"that still hadn't heated up very much at this time. "), ('./static/4.mp4', 391, u'We were still going to classes and thinking about so '), ('./static/4.mp4', 397, u"that's kind of sets the scene from then and "), ('./static/4.mp4', 401, u'I guess then my next thing is then to be George and '), ('./static/4.mp4', 406, u"introduce tonight's speaker. "), ('./static/4.mp4', 416, u'Okay people in the back, come up in front, have a seat. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 420, u'Welcome to our weekly colloquium. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 424, u"I'm happy to announce that we'll be able to meet "), ('./static/4.mp4', 429, u'again in Polya Hall starting at the end of this month. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 433, u'Now tonight, this afternoon speaker is one of our own. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 437, u"I'm really happy to introduce Dan Connolly to join our faculty few weeks ago. "), ('./static/4.mp4', 444, u'And I know some of that he is teaching '), ('./static/4.mp4', 449, u'our introductory class of 136. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 455, u'This is gonna become 106 [LAUGH]. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 460, u'And so you probably also know that he wrote a book called '), ('./static/4.mp4', 466, u'The Art of Computer Programming that took the first volume came out last year and '), ('./static/4.mp4', 473, u'the second volume came out this summer and '), ('./static/4.mp4', 477, u"I've been told that his books have set a new record at the Stanford library. "), ('./static/4.mp4', 485, u'That no other book in the history of the library has been stolen so often, '), ('./static/4.mp4', 489, u'>> [LAUGH] '), ('./static/4.mp4', 490, u">> From Stanford's library. "), ('./static/4.mp4', 492, u"So now he's gonna give a talk about a kind of a strange "), ('./static/4.mp4', 498, u"topic called the analysis of algorithms, so I'm looking forward to what he says. "), ('./static/4.mp4', 502, u'Don? '), ('./static/4.mp4', 504, u'>> [APPLAUSE] '), ('./static/4.mp4', 510, u'>> Thanks. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 514, u"Well, I'm really happy to be here, and at last, "), ('./static/4.mp4', 518, u'I can officially Call myself a computer scientist. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 521, u'And this is my, solves my identity crisis. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 528, u'And I can become part of this terrific faculty that we have here at Stanford. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 534, u'And in fact, even more important than the wonderful faculty. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 537, u'That Stanford has is our students. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 539, u"I think it's quite clear that we've got the absolute, best students. "), ('./static/4.mp4', 545, u"In fact in this room this afternoon, we've got a substantial "), ('./static/4.mp4', 550, u'fraction of the best computer science students in the whole world, '), ('./static/4.mp4', 554, u"and I'm especially happy to be also here to, "), ('./static/4.mp4', 559, u'to work with my long time colleague Bob Floyd. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 565, u"Although previously we've done all our work by mail. "), ('./static/4.mp4', 569, u'And writing letters back and forth frantically. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 572, u"So at last we're going to be able to work together as colleagues and face to face. "), ('./static/4.mp4', 579, u'George asked me to give a talk that sort of introduces what I do, '), ('./static/4.mp4', 586, u"since this is the first time I'm talking here in public "), ('./static/4.mp4', 592, u'at Stanford after getting this appointment. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 599, u'And it reminds me that earlier this year, my colleague, Claus Worth. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 607, u"I'm sort of Claus's "), ('./static/4.mp4', 611, u'replacement here because Claus was called to be a professor at ETH in Zurich. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 616, u'And so Europeans have a wonderful tradition of the inaugural lecture. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 624, u"It's kind of a big deal that the professor's first lecture in Europe "), ('./static/4.mp4', 630, u'is reported in the newspapers and so on. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 636, u"Now, I'm not going to give a talk that's going to get reported in any newspaper. "), ('./static/4.mp4', 639, u"In fact, it's kind of depressing to read the newspapers these days anyway. "), ('./static/4.mp4', 642, u'But I do want to give a talk that could be considered in some way an inaugural thing. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 651, u'The subject is really what do I sort of '), ('./static/4.mp4', 656, u"view as what I want to work on while I'm at Stanford. "), ('./static/4.mp4', 661, u'Is there some general theme or something that underlies it all? '), ('./static/4.mp4', 665, u'So [SOUND] so much for that. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 671, u'Actually, now I have to actually speak again from here. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 677, u"Unfortunately Emily's "), ('./static/4.mp4', 682, u'boss decided that Class X was such a classy project. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 687, u"It wouldn't be good for me to wear a wig throughout this whole "), ('./static/4.mp4', 692, u'presentation because Stanford is a very serious institution.

"), ('./static/4.mp4', 715, u'>> [LAUGH] >> So '), ('./static/4.mp4', 718, u"maybe that will be enough to remind me that I'm speaking from the 70s. "), ('./static/4.mp4', 723, u'Okay now. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 723, u"[LAUGH] >> Let's go back then. "), ('./static/4.mp4', 726, u'So what is this strange title, The Analysis of Algorithms? '), ('./static/4.mp4', 731, u'Well I can explain that, but actually it goes back to a story. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 736, u'A couple years ago I was at a conference of mathematicians in Santa Barbara. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 743, u'And somebody asked me at dinner, what do you do? '), ('./static/4.mp4', 747, u"And I said I'm a computer scientist. "), ('./static/4.mp4', 751, u'And computer scientist. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 753, u'Are you a numerical analyst? '), ('./static/4.mp4', 757, u'And I said well, no, I like numbers and '), ('./static/4.mp4', 761, u"things like this but numerical analysis isn't quite the description of what I do. "), ('./static/4.mp4', 766, u'So, I said, artificial intelligence? '), ('./static/4.mp4', 770, u'And, I said, well, no, not really that either. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 772, u'And, so, the guy says, then you must be a language man. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 777, u'You see, in those days, computer science consisted of three possible things. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 784, u'One was numerical analysis. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 786, u'One was artificial intelligence and third was programming languages. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 792, u'Study of languages, formal languages that are used to describe algorithms. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 801, u'Okay, well. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 803, u"But it occurred to me that really I wasn't in any of those categories and so "), ('./static/4.mp4', 806, u'I had no way to explain what I do, or what I did. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 810, u'And so that night I started thinking about it and said, '), ('./static/4.mp4', 813, u'well wait a minute, I gotta have a name for what I like to do. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 820, u"And so I came up with the, to say I'm okay, "), ('./static/4.mp4', 824, u"the next time somebody asks me what I do, I'm gonna say an analysis of algorithms. "), ('./static/4.mp4', 829, u"I didn't really know exactly what it meant at the time but "), ('./static/4.mp4', 831, u'I knew that I needed names so I pictured it, you know, '), ('./static/4.mp4', 834, u'Richard Bellman made up the name dynamic programming and everybody gots '), ('./static/4.mp4', 839, u'started using it and so I figured if I started talking about it long enough, '), ('./static/4.mp4', 844, u'it would become a well known display. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 850, u'But anyway, I did know that what I liked to do was analyze algorithms. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 857, u'I mean I liked algorithms. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 860, u"I don't have to explain to you guys what an algorithm is. "), ('./static/4.mp4', 862, u'But when I went to quantitatively studying algorithms and not just qualitatively. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 871, u"So I'm gonna explain to you by example. "), ('./static/4.mp4', 875, u"I still haven't really come up with a perfect definition of what "), ('./static/4.mp4', 878, u'it means The Analysis of Algorithms. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 880, u'But by example, I mean the working definition is, '), ('./static/4.mp4', 886, u"whatever I'm interested in is analysis of value. "), ('./static/4.mp4', 889, u'>> [LAUGH] >> I tend to refine this over the years, '), ('./static/4.mp4', 893, u'but by giving an example, I think I can explain to you what is. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 900, u'>> What is sort of special about it. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 903, u"So, let's take an example. "), ('./static/4.mp4', 905, u"I want to, I'm gonna work a simple algorithm "), ('./static/4.mp4', 912, u'so that we can sort of analyze it to the hilt and here we go. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 920, u'So the algorithm is going to be defined as '), ('./static/4.mp4', 924, u'the maximum of n number. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 930, u'So one through xn, got to find the maximum. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 938, u'So here we go. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 940, u'Start out. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 941, u'>> Come in here and the first step is '), ('./static/4.mp4', 946, u'I set m to x sub n, and I set k to n- 1. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 956, u"All right, that's the very first step. "), ('./static/4.mp4', 960, u'After that I make a test. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 967, u'Is K=0 or not, okay. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 973, u"Sorry, I haven't developed my skills at writing good "), ('./static/4.mp4', 978, u'zeroes on the blackboard here. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 984, u'So I got two variables here, M and K, '), ('./static/4.mp4', 989, u'and I start out and I, that way, and '), ('./static/4.mp4', 994, u'so it might be that K is equal to zero. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 1001, u"And then I'm gonna come do that, but if K is not zero. "), ('./static/4.mp4', 1005, u"Then I've got to make another test and I will write that down so "), ('./static/4.mp4', 1011, u"that is Xk bigger than M and again, it's yes or no. "), ('./static/4.mp4', 1020, u"So, I'm gonna write, I'm to put this logarithm down, and we'll play it, "), ('./static/4.mp4', 1023, u'through it. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 1024, u"And, you'll understand exactly what it does. "), ('./static/4.mp4', 1030, u'So, the S is saying, m equates by x k, '), ('./static/4.mp4', 1037, u'and no says k is set to k minus 1. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 1042, u'And these come out here and go all the way back. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 1048, u'And so I got the algorithm out here except for what happens under yes, '), ('./static/4.mp4', 1052, u'and at the end here it says output m. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 1058, u'And there we are. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 1060, u'Okay, so this is, I think, '), ('./static/4.mp4', 1062, u'if anybody here has written this half a dozen programs they probably came '), ('./static/4.mp4', 1067, u"up with a loop somewhere in one of those programs that's very much like, like this. "), ('./static/4.mp4', 1073, u'So it should be fairly familiar. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 1077, u"But let's take an example and play through. "), ('./static/4.mp4', 1080, u'So suppose that n is 4 and '), ('./static/4.mp4', 1086, u'the x1 is say 2.3 and '), ('./static/4.mp4', 1091, u'x2 is 7.1, x3 is 4.0. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 1097, u'X4 is 5.9, by the way if anybody has a question on what '), ('./static/4.mp4', 1102, u"I'm saying stop me right away.x I want to know unless "), ('./static/4.mp4', 1107, u"you don't understand anything and then you can't ask anything. "), ('./static/4.mp4', 1114, u'>> [LAUGHTER] But anyway, ask me and '), ('./static/4.mp4', 1117, u"I'll try to answer [INAUDIBLE] your chance okay? "), ('./static/4.mp4', 1122, u'So, we start out and the first part of, and '), ('./static/4.mp4', 1126, u'we set m is going to be, '), ('./static/4.mp4', 1131, u'is going to be set to 5.9 which is x4, xn? '), ('./static/4.mp4', 1137, u'Is 5.9 and k is set to n-1 which is 3. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 1142, u"All right, so that's this step. "), ('./static/4.mp4', 1144, u'We come down here and we say is k 0? '), ('./static/4.mp4', 1147, u'Nope. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 1149, u'So then we check if xk is greater than m. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 1153, u"So xk is 4.0, is 4.0 bigger than 5.9, nope, it's not. "), ('./static/4.mp4', 1160, u'So, we down here we change K to 2 and go back, '), ('./static/4.mp4', 1169, u"now again we ask is K through 0 it's not, so we come through and "), ('./static/4.mp4', 1174, u'now we check X equals. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 1176, u'7.1 X2 against M. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 1179, u'Is that bigger than M? '), ('./static/4.mp4', 1180, u'Yeah it is. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 1182, u'So you come through here and M gets changed to 7.1. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 1188, u'And then that takes us over here, K goes down to one. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 1194, u"That's not zero yet so we still, I'll check 2.3 against m and "), ('./static/4.mp4', 1201, u"it's not bigger, so that k moves to zero. "), ('./static/4.mp4', 1205, u'Yes, output m answer this is the maximum all right so '), ('./static/4.mp4', 1211, u"I don't think there was really a doubt but "), ('./static/4.mp4', 1216, u'I want to show you that I understand what a flow chart is.

'), ('./static/4.mp4', 2382, u'George Boole actually worked '), ('./static/4.mp4', 2387, u'a lot on this kind of problems. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 2392, u'And so well, I decided to add a new course '), ('./static/4.mp4', 2397, u"to Stanford's curriculum next fall. "), ('./static/4.mp4', 2403, u"So next fall I'm gonna introduce a class called concrete mathematics. "), ('./static/4.mp4', 2406, u'And it should be great, so stick around. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 2410, u'Now, okay, the other thing I wanna mention is that of course, '), ('./static/4.mp4', 2415, u"this a very simple algorithm that we're analyzing, but "), ('./static/4.mp4', 2420, u"the techniques that we're using here are techniques that I use over and "), ('./static/4.mp4', 2425, u'over again in different ways. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 2428, u'And so I realized actually, rather early, '), ('./static/4.mp4', 2435, u'that I would never run out of good problems if I was analyzing algorithms. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 2441, u'I knew that there was a whole '), ('./static/4.mp4', 2445, u'field called queuing theory that a lot of people worked on, '), ('./static/4.mp4', 2450, u'and this was just the analysis of a small, a certain special kind of algorithm. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 2455, u'So if I broaden that and say okay, well, queuing theory was one kind of algorithm, '), ('./static/4.mp4', 2460, u'let me take all the important algorithms of the world and analyze those. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 2465, u"I'll never run out of challenging and fulfilling problems to work on. "), ('./static/4.mp4', 2471, u"And in fact, there's an extra. "), ('./static/4.mp4', 2475, u'Not only is it fun to work on these problems, but also '), ('./static/4.mp4', 2480, u'when I get the answer, there are people out there who appreciate the answer. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 2485, u'So what could be a better way to spend my life? '), ('./static/4.mp4', 2490, u"Okay now, let's then proceed further and take a look at these numbers. "), ('./static/4.mp4', 2496, u'Well. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 2501, u'One of the next steps is to [COUGH] is to think '), ('./static/4.mp4', 2506, u'about these numbers as coefficients of a polynomial. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 2514, u"So let's consider a polynomial, and "), ('./static/4.mp4', 2519, u'I call that it 1 + z, 2 + 3z + z squared, '), ('./static/4.mp4', 2524, u'6 + 11z = 6z squared + z cubed and so on. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 2530, u'Now. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 2535, u'The reason I do this is because I know that the way that I got from one line to '), ('./static/4.mp4', 2540, u"the next was very much like something I do when I'm multiplying polynomials. "), ('./static/4.mp4', 2547, u'Because, if I look at this polynomial, '), ('./static/4.mp4', 2550, u'this turns out to be (1 + z)(2 + z). '), ('./static/4.mp4', 2554, u'And this one turns out to be (1 + z)(2 + z)(3 + z). '), ('./static/4.mp4', 2562, u'Because the rule that I used to get from one line to the next '), ('./static/4.mp4', 2566, u'was multiply this by 3 and shift over. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 2570, u"That's exactly the same like as saying multiply by (3 + z). "), ('./static/4.mp4', 2575, u'So you could guess what this is gonna factor out. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 2582, u'And so now we get a formula then. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 2589, u"Okay, as they said, I've found out that "), ('./static/4.mp4', 2594, u'these numbers were identified, '), ('./static/4.mp4', 2598, u'I mean called Stirling numbers, so it turned out that p of n, '), ('./static/4.mp4', 2605, u'on a k, is called a Stirling number, '), ('./static/4.mp4', 2609, u'and upstairs n, k + 1 downstairs. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 2614, u"So actually, I had a closed formula saying exactly what's the number of "), ('./static/4.mp4', 2620, u"cases that I'm gonna have to change the maximum that many time. "), ('./static/4.mp4', 2626, u'Okay, and I also found out that statisticians knew about his stuff, '), ('./static/4.mp4', 2634, u'but I think the first statistician who first studied this were like 1954, '), ('./static/4.mp4', 2638, u'something like that. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 2639, u'But anyway, they did study what they call a record breakers in sports events. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 2645, u'And so you wanted to say how many times does the lead change, or '), ('./static/4.mp4', 2649, u'something like that. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 2651, u'So starting numbers came up this way and '), ('./static/4.mp4', 2655, u'then the probability pnk is then I have this '), ('./static/4.mp4', 2661, u'formula and this divided by n factorial, somehow explaining it. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 2667, u"Okay now I've got a picture here that you can see to show just "), ('./static/4.mp4', 2671, u'n gets a little bit bigger. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 2674, u'I prepared, oops. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 2684, u"So here's n equals 12. "), ('./static/4.mp4', 2687, u"That's as far as I can compute at the moment "), ('./static/4.mp4', 2692, u'without getting numbers that are too big for my computer, but it '), ('./static/4.mp4', 2698, u'gives typical results that we can imagine. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 2701, u"N equals 12, you see that these are the capital p's here. "), ('./static/4.mp4', 2708, u'And so they get really tiny up here, and close to here looks '), ('./static/4.mp4', 2713, u'like this most of the time, we changed the maximum two times. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 2719, u'So what about when n is a million? '), ('./static/4.mp4', 2723, u"If I'm finding the maximum of a million numbers, I'd like to figure out "), ('./static/4.mp4', 2728, u'how many times the max was gonna change, '), ('./static/4.mp4', 2734, u"but it doesn't look like it's gonna be anywhere near half of a million. "), ('./static/4.mp4', 2739, u'But our next goal is try to figure out the behavior of this thing '), ('./static/4.mp4', 2743, u'as n gets larger and see more about what it is. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 2748, u'So Here '), ('./static/4.mp4', 2753, u'comes a great idea called generating function. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 2758, u'So instead of having the formula written out as a Stirling number and '), ('./static/4.mp4', 2767, u'everything like that, it turns out to be better to have the generating function, '), ('./static/4.mp4', 2772, u'which I want to explain. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 2776, u'But it was (1 + z)(2 + z), '), ('./static/4.mp4', 2782, u'up to n- 1 + z divided by n factorial. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 2790, u'So this is n factorial. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 2795, u'And this is equal to the summation of p of k. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 2802, u"I'm sorry, n, k times z to the k. "), ('./static/4.mp4', 2808, u'So the coefficient of z to the k is this probability that a is equal to k. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 2815, u"And it didn't take long when I was working on it, analyzing algorithms, "), ('./static/4.mp4', 2820, u'to realize that Generating functions were a wonderful way to approach it. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 2829, u'Why is that? '), ('./static/4.mp4', 2830, u'In fact, this was of course discovered 200 years earlier by Lagrange and '), ('./static/4.mp4', 2836, u'so on and Mejean. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 2838, u"But I didn't know it at the time. "), ('./static/4.mp4', 2840, u'From what I had been taught in school, I had my statistics teacher had talked '), ('./static/4.mp4', 2845, u'about something called the characteristic function, which turned out to be the same, '), ('./static/4.mp4', 2849, u'but z was called e to the it or something like that. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 2852, u"I didn't recognize it. "), ('./static/4.mp4', 2853, u'So [COUGH] why are generating functions great? '), ('./static/4.mp4', 2859, u"Well, most times when we're trying to find average values, "), ('./static/4.mp4', 2866, u"we don't know the exact value for p of nk. "), ('./static/4.mp4', 2870, u"We don't have a closed formula for it. "), ('./static/4.mp4', 2873, u'Stirling only invented a certain number of numbers, and '), ('./static/4.mp4', 2876, u'there are many more problems than are known numbers. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 2878, u'But often from the generating function, we can still find out what we need to '), ('./static/4.mp4', 2883, u'know about those numbers because a generating function is one object. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 2887, u'g n of z, while the numbers here are sort of n objects. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 2894, u'And so we have, the generating function is one thing that we can work with and '), ('./static/4.mp4', 2898, u'learn about, and deduce the p. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 2902, u"So, here's the point. "), ('./static/4.mp4', 2904, u'Forget n for a moment, '), ('./static/4.mp4', 2907, u'as long as g of z is equal to p of 0 + p 1 z Into '), ('./static/4.mp4', 2912, u'the square at 0. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 2917, u'Then we know that g of 1 '), ('./static/4.mp4', 2923, u'is equal to, we plug in z = 1, and you get the sum of all probabilities. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 2928, u'So this is equal to 1. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 2930, u"Next, let's look at the derivative. "), ('./static/4.mp4', 2937, u'So I take the derivative with respect to z and '), ('./static/4.mp4', 2942, u'I get p1 + 2p2z- 3p3z squared and so on. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 2949, u"That's nice. "), ('./static/4.mp4', 2950, u"Because g'(1) is equal to the mean "), ('./static/4.mp4', 2956, u'of the average of the expected value of this probability. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 2962, u"It's the sum of you know P1+2P2+3P3 that's exactly what we said, that's the average. "), ('./static/4.mp4', 2969, u"So that's the number we want to get. "), ('./static/4.mp4', 2972, u"And while I'm at it I may as well show you the next step. "), ('./static/4.mp4', 2977, u'Because I did say I wanted to get the standard eviation as well. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 2983, u'So this is 2p2- plus 3 times 2 p3 z '), ('./static/4.mp4', 2988, u'and so on, 4 times 3 p4 z. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 2994, u'And so g double prime is gonna '), ('./static/4.mp4', 3000, u'be the sum of k (k- 1) p k, and if I add g double prime. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 3010, u'G double prime, plus g prime, '), ('./static/4.mp4', 3013, u'this is the sum of k squared times Ek. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 3022, u'So, and I might as well go all the way to the next step, then. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 3028, u'And I get the variance of g which is, '), ('./static/4.mp4', 3032, u'the standard deviation squared is '), ('./static/4.mp4', 3037, u'by definition equal to the variance, and this is then g double prime. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 3042, u'1 plus g prime of 1 minus g prime of 1 squared, right? '), ('./static/4.mp4', 3049, u'Either subtract it but this turns out to be the one on quantity '), ('./static/4.mp4', 3056, u"by which we measure deviation form, it's the square of the, "), ('./static/4.mp4', 3063, u'If the average value of the square of difference of a minus its mean. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 3069, u"So that's the indication of how stable "), ('./static/4.mp4', 3074, u'the thing is about the mean value. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 3079, u"Now, the point is it's really easy to calculate the average of "), ('./static/4.mp4', 3090, u'this particular generating function and the reason is that '), ('./static/4.mp4', 3098, u'when we have a product of two generating functions '), ('./static/4.mp4', 3102, u'then the average is just the sum of the two averages. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 3105, u"So here I'm going to show you that, it's so nice. "), ('./static/4.mp4', 3117, u'If we have a generating function g(z) and another generating function h(z). '), ('./static/4.mp4', 3125, u'And so the product of these two is it gives you another set of probabilities and '), ('./static/4.mp4', 3130, u'so if I can simply call this capital G, what the heck. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 3136, u'No, let me take another word. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 3139, u'So capital G(z) is equal to g1(z). '), ('./static/4.mp4', 3145, u"Well g(z) that's okay. "), ('./static/4.mp4', 3149, u'Just like So '), ('./static/4.mp4', 3154, u'It works out that the G(1) = 1. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 3161, u'This is values to 1, this is values to 1. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 3166, u'1 * 1 = 1. So all these probabilities of one '), ('./static/4.mp4', 3168, u'makes some kind of probability. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 3171, u'And furthermore, G prime of z is just G prime of '), ('./static/4.mp4', 3177, u'z h and z not plus G z h file z. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 3183, u'And so G prime of 1 is equal to little g prime of 1. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 3191, u'And h1 is 1, and this one is 1, so '), ('./static/4.mp4', 3194, u'this comes out to h1. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 3198, u'Okay? So the average, so '), ('./static/4.mp4', 3200, u'if we can factor a generating function as a product of other, simpler generating '), ('./static/4.mp4', 3205, u'functions, then to get the mean, we just have to add up the individual ones. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 3209, u'And it turned out the same thing for the variance. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 3214, u'That is, if I take G double prime '), ('./static/4.mp4', 3219, u'+ G prime- G prime squared, '), ('./static/4.mp4', 3223, u'it turns out to be little g prime delta '), ('./static/4.mp4', 3228, u'[INAUDIBLE] + [INAUDIBLE] [SOUND] So '), ('./static/4.mp4', 3233, u'the some of the two variance [SOUND] '), ('./static/4.mp4', 3238, u"it's the sum of the two variance. "), ('./static/4.mp4', 3243, u'So when you factorized it, everything becomes simple. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 3248, u'Now, these are then '), ('./static/4.mp4', 3253, u'give us the answer to our original question and so, '), ('./static/4.mp4', 3258, u"let's see, where was I? "), ('./static/4.mp4', 3263, u'Yeah, so, what do I get for the total my '), ('./static/4.mp4', 3269, u'generating function was 1+z/ 1*2+z/3 and '), ('./static/4.mp4', 3276, u'ended up n-1=z/n each of this is '), ('./static/4.mp4', 3280, u'the generating function by itself and '), ('./static/4.mp4', 3285, u'the average of this one is one-half, '), ('./static/4.mp4', 3290, u'this one is one-third, this one is 1/n. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 3296, u'Right, this is 1. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 3298, u'I mean you could '), ('./static/4.mp4', 3302, u'take the derivative and valuate it at 1, until, one-half, one-third, so on. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 3306, u'And so, the sum of these is the average, except that okay. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 3314, u'So now, here, this turns out, '), ('./static/4.mp4', 3318, u'then, to be the harmonic number minus 1. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 3322, u'The harmonic number, a sub n is defined to be the sum '), ('./static/4.mp4', 3327, u'of the first reciprocal starting with 1 instead of with a hat. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 3331, u'So the answer is then. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 3334, u'Is Hn-1 here. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 3335, u'And the standard deviation works out to be the square '), ('./static/4.mp4', 3340, u'root of Hn minus the second order harmonic number, '), ('./static/4.mp4', 3345, u'which is the sum of the squares of, '), ('./static/4.mp4', 3349, u'like one-half squared plus one-third squared. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 3354, u"1 over n square, so these are the, so there's answers, "), ('./static/4.mp4', 3359, u'the original question saying that the average turns '), ('./static/4.mp4', 3364, u'out to be this harmonic number which then we get to know '), ('./static/4.mp4', 3370, u'is Is very much like the logarithm and if n is a million, '), ('./static/4.mp4', 3375, u'it turns out to be about 13 and a half, so okay. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 3380, u"So that's the, it tells you that we're not going to be "), ('./static/4.mp4', 3384, u'changing the next one very much often in the meantime. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 3390, u'And once again this quantity a sub n, '), ('./static/4.mp4', 3393, u'harmonic number was appearing in zillions of '), ('./static/4.mp4', 3398, u'different algorithms that I was studying. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 3402, u"So even though as I'd been a math student I'd run into some of these reciprocals, "), ('./static/4.mp4', 3410, u'maybe half a dozen times somewhere in my education. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 3414, u'All of a sudden I realized that if I was gonna be analyzing algorithms '), ('./static/4.mp4', 3419, u"I'd not only have to know kind of about hn but "), ('./static/4.mp4', 3422, u"I'd have to know how to calculate the sum of k times h sub k and "), ('./static/4.mp4', 3427, u"I'd have to know how to calculate the sum of hn squared and I had to know all "), ('./static/4.mp4', 3432, u"kinds of things about these numbers hn that I hadn't been taught before. "), ('./static/4.mp4', 3437, u'And that was because the computer applications were telling me this '), ('./static/4.mp4', 3442, u'was a part of mathematics that I really could have learned if it '), ('./static/4.mp4', 3446, u"hadn't faded out of history. "), ('./static/4.mp4', 3449, u"So that's why I'm going to try to teach this course, "), ('./static/4.mp4', 3452, u'conquering math next fall, that brings us into the curriculum. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 3458, u"From a practical point of view now I've analyzed this algorithm. "), ('./static/4.mp4', 3462, u'What does that tell me about? '), ('./static/4.mp4', 3467, u"It wasn't riding a compiler. "), ('./static/4.mp4', 3470, u'Does that tell me something about how to arrange the code? '), ('./static/4.mp4', 3477, u'Well, in the first place, I actually I '), ('./static/4.mp4', 3482, u'already made the first simplification when I presented the algorithm I started out '), ('./static/4.mp4', 3487, u'with k equals n minus 1 instead of starting out with k equals 0. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 3493, u'I could have started out k equals 1 and go up and say k equals n here. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 3500, u'And while I knew that a computer it was easier to test for 0 than to test for n. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 3506, u"And since I'm doing this every time, "), ('./static/4.mp4', 3507, u'I wanted this test to be as simple as I could. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 3509, u'So I already biased that when I wrote the program by '), ('./static/4.mp4', 3514, u'counting downward instead of going up. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 3518, u"But then it also the analysis tells us that almost always we're gonna "), ('./static/4.mp4', 3522, u'come down this branch and hardly ever are we gonna be tripping around in here, so '), ('./static/4.mp4', 3527, u'what the computer can be spending its time going zip, zip, '), ('./static/4.mp4', 3531, u'zip like this all the time. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 3532, u'And so, this will tell us not only that, well we should arrange the programs, '), ('./static/4.mp4', 3538, u'the instructions in memory so that this path is nice, and '), ('./static/4.mp4', 3542, u'the computer goes fast as it can zip on these instructions. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 3547, u"But then I wouldn't have to make a side trip but then we don't really care so "), ('./static/4.mp4', 3552, u'much about what it does to fix up, and even more so, '), ('./static/4.mp4', 3556, u'we can realize that we could double up on this loop, and we could combine '), ('./static/4.mp4', 3562, u'several values of k, we only have to test to see if k is getting small. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 3568, u'Say is k bigger than five or not, and if not the we can do five of these tests '), ('./static/4.mp4', 3572, u"right away without making separate tests each time, and so next summer I'm "), ('./static/4.mp4', 3578, u'gonna be running a project where I want about a dozen volunteers to go through and '), ('./static/4.mp4', 3585, u'see what the programs people are writing at Stanford. '), ('./static/4.mp4', 3590, u"And we're going to scour the waste baskets and look at where we can "), ('./static/4.mp4', 3594, u'get wherever we can and see what people are actually doing in their programs.
